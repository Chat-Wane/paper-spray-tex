  Random peer sampling is an essential ground to many distributed
  applications. Since the peers cannot afford to have global knowledge of the
  network membership, they only have a partial view of the latter. However,
  current approaches either lake of adaptiveness (e.g. \CYCLON{}) or resilience
  (e.g. \SCAMP{}). Furthermore, they do not consider three-way handshake
  connections set-up which becomes increasingly important with technologies
  such as WebRTC. In this paper, we introduce \SCAMPLON{}, a random peer
  sampling protocol
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item which provides a logarithmic partial view size in average to each
    peer,
  \item which quickly converges to a random graph,
  \item which can handle three-way handshake.
  \end{inparaenum}
  Experiments shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both in
  one-way connections and three-way handshake connections.
