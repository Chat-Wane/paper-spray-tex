  Deploying peer-sampling service on top of WebRTC allow to run large
  scale distributed applications on a network of browsers. However,
  WebRTC has several constraints that makes existing peer-sampling
  service inefficient or unreliable.  In this paper, we propose
  \SCAMPLON{}, an adaptative peer-sampling service designed to meet
  WebRTC constraints. \SCAMPLON{} dynamically adapts the neighborhood
  of each peer to the size of network. It only uses
  neighbor-to-neighbor interactions to establish the connections and
  converges exponentially fast to a random graph. On experiments, we
  demonstrated how \SCAMPLON{} saves connections compared to\CYCLON{}
  at the cost of a little overhead.
