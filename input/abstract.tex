  Peer-sampling protocols constitute a fundamental mechanism for a
  number of large-scale distributed applications. The recent
  introduction of WebRTC facilitated the deployment of decentralized
  applications over a network of browsers. However, deploying existing
  peer-sampling protocols on top of WebRTC raises issues about their
  lack of adaptiveness to sudden bursts of popularity over a network
  that does not manage addressing or routing. \SPRAY is a novel random
  peer-sampling protocol that dynamically, quickly, and efficiently
  self-adapts to the network size. Our experiments show the
  flexibility of \SPRAY and highlight its efficiency improvements at
  the cost of small overhead. We embedded \SPRAY in a real-time
  decentralized editor running in browsers and ran experiments
  involving up to 600 communicating web browsers. The results
  demonstrate that \SPRAY significantly reduces the network traffic
  according to the number of participants and saves bandwidth.

  % The introduction of WebRTC has opened a new playground for large-scale
  % distributed applications running in web browsers. Peer sampling protocols can
  % be used to maintain connectivity between devices. However, they do not adapt
  % to networks that can grow and shrink.  As a result, traffic can be oversized.
  % In this paper, we address the limitations of current peer sampling approaches
  % by introducing \SPRAY, a novel adaptive peer sampling protocol that maintains
  % local neighborhood tables that logarithmically scale with the total number of
  % network members. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of \SPRAY to adapt to
  % dynamic networks, reducing the number of WebRTC connections needed to maintain
  % browsers connected. To validate our proposal, we built a real-time
  % decentralized editor running in browsers, thus on laptops, tablets and mobile
  % phones. We ran experiments involving up to 600 communicating web browsers. The
  % results demonstrate that \SPRAY significantly reduces the network traffic

% \begin{abstract}
%   The introduction of WebRTC has opened a new playground for large-scale
%   distributed applications consisting of large numbers of directly-communicating
%   web browsers. In this context, gossip-based peer-sampling protocols appear as
%   a particularly promising tool thanks to their inherent ability to build
%   overlay networks that can cope with network dynamics. However, \TODO{the
%     dynamic nature of browser-to-browser communication} combined with the
%   connection establishment procedures that characterize WebRTC make current
%   peer-sampling solutions inefficient or simply unreliable.  In this paper, we
%   address the limitations of current peer-sampling approaches by introducing
%   \SPRAY, a novel peer-sampling protocol designed to avoid the constraints
%   introduced by WebRTC. Unlike most recent peer-sampling approaches, \SPRAY has
%   the ability to adapt its operation to networks that can grow or shrink very
%   rapidly. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of \SPRAY to adapt to dynamic
%   networks and highlight its efficiency improvements with respect to existing
%   protocols. We built a real-time decentralized editor and ran experimentation
%   involving uptill 600 communicating web browsers. Results highlight the
%   benefits brought by \SPRAY's adaptiveness over \TODO{protocols depending} on
%   it.
