  Recently, WebRTC allowed the connection establishment between web browsers,
  even with complex network settings such as firewall, proxies or Net Address
  Translation (NAT).  It eases the end-user access to distributed
  applications. However, several applications require to broadcast messages to
  a potentially large number of participants. Traditionally, gossiping
  algorithms handle such broadcast. Unfortunately, current gossiping algorithms
  raise reliablity and efficiency issues in the WebRTC context, where the
  connection establishement uses a three-way handshake protocol. Indeed, since
  the peers cannot afford to have global knowledge of the network membership,
  they only have a partial view of the latter. However, current approaches
  either lake of adaptiveness (e.g. \CYCLON{}) or robustness
  (e.g. \SCAMP{}). In this paper, we introduce \SCAMPLON{}, a random peer
  sampling protocol
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item which provides a logarithmic partial view size in average to each
    peer,
  \item which quickly converges to a random graph,
  \item which can handle three-way handshake.
  \end{inparaenum}
  Experimentation shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches
  both in the traditionnal and the three-way handshake connection set-up.
