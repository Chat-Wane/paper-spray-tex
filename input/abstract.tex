  The introduction of WebRTC has opened a new playground for large-scale
  distributed applications consisting of large numbers of directly-communicating
  web browsers. In this context, gossip-based peer-sampling protocols appear as
  a particularly promising tool thanks to their inherent ability to build
  overlay networks that can cope with network dynamics. However, the dynamic
  nature of browser-to-browser communication combined with the connection
  establishment procedures that characterize WebRTC make current peer-sampling
  solutions inefficient or simply unreliable.  In this paper, we address the
  limitations of current peer-sampling approaches by introducing \SPRAY, a novel
  peer-sampling protocol designed to avoid the constraints introduced by
  WebRTC. Unlike most recent peer-sampling approaches, \SPRAY has the ability to
  adapt its operation to networks that can grow or shrink very rapidly. In
  turns, gossiping on top of \SPRAY also becomes adaptive. Our experiments
  demonstrate the ability of \SPRAY to adapt to dynamic networks and highlight
  its efficiency improvements with respect to existing protocols. We highlight
  the improvement over gossiping using experiments involving uptill 600
  decentralized real-time editors in browsers.
