  The introduction of WebRTC has opened a new playground for large-scale
  distributed applications running in web browsers. Peer sampling protocols
  can be used to maintain connectivity between devices. However, they do not adapt to 
  networks that
  can grow or shrink very rapidly. As a result, traffic can be \TODO{oversized}.
  In this paper, we address the limitations of current peer sampling approaches
  by introducing \SPRAY, a novel adaptive peer sampling protocol that maintains
  local \TODO{routing} tables that logarithmically scale with the total
  number of \TODO{participants}. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of
  \SPRAY to adapt to dynamic networks, reducing the number of WebRTC connections
  needed to maintain browsers connected. To validate our proposal, we built a
  real-time decentralized editor running in browsers \TODO{on laptops, tablets
    and mobile phones}. We ran experiments involving up to 600
  communicating web browsers. The results demonstrate that \SPRAY significantly
  reduces the network traffic according to the number of participants and saves
  bandwidth.

% \begin{abstract}
%   The introduction of WebRTC has opened a new playground for large-scale
%   distributed applications consisting of large numbers of directly-communicating
%   web browsers. In this context, gossip-based peer-sampling protocols appear as
%   a particularly promising tool thanks to their inherent ability to build
%   overlay networks that can cope with network dynamics. However, \TODO{the
%     dynamic nature of browser-to-browser communication} combined with the
%   connection establishment procedures that characterize WebRTC make current
%   peer-sampling solutions inefficient or simply unreliable.  In this paper, we
%   address the limitations of current peer-sampling approaches by introducing
%   \SPRAY, a novel peer-sampling protocol designed to avoid the constraints
%   introduced by WebRTC. Unlike most recent peer-sampling approaches, \SPRAY has
%   the ability to adapt its operation to networks that can grow or shrink very
%   rapidly. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of \SPRAY to adapt to dynamic
%   networks and highlight its efficiency improvements with respect to existing
%   protocols. We built a real-time decentralized editor and ran experimentation
%   involving uptill 600 communicating web browsers. Results highlight the
%   benefits brought by \SPRAY's adaptiveness over \TODO{protocols depending} on
%   it.
