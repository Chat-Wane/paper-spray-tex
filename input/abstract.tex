  Deploying peer sampling services on top of WebRTC allows running large scale
  distributed applications on a network of browsers. However, WebRTC has
  several constraints that makes existing peer sampling services inefficient or
  unreliable.  In this paper, we propose \SCAMPLON{}, an adaptive
  peer-sampling service designed to meet the WebRTC constraints. \SCAMPLON{}
  dynamically adapts the neighborhood of each peer to the network
  size. Furthermore, it only uses neighbor-to-neighbor interactions to
  establish the connections and converges exponentially fast to a topology
  exposing properties similar to random graphs. Experiments demonstrate the
  adaptiveness of \SCAMPLON{} and highlight its efficiency improvement compared
  to \CYCLON{} at the cost of a small overhead.
