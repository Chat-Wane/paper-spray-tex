\label{sec:background}

This section introduces the general outlines of protocols in charge of
providing the peer sampling. Then, it details two state-of-the-art
approaches that will be useful later on. Finally, we highlight the motivations
of our approach.

\subsection{Random peer sampling}
Peer sampling protocols~\cite{jelasity2004peer} provide each peer with a
partial view $\mathcal{P}$ of the network membership $\mathcal{N}$. In this
paper, we focus on random peer sampling protocols where these latter populate
the partial views with peers chosen at random among $\mathcal{N}$ following a
uniform distribution. They aim to converge to a random graph, hence, providing
robustness and efficient epidemic spreading of messages. A wide variety of
gossip-based protocols use random peer sampling (e.g. topology
management~\cite{voulgaris2005epidemic,jelasity2009tman}). Nonetheless,
providing each peer with a uniform random sample relying solely on local
knowledge remains challenging (REF?).  Our \SCAMPLON{} protocol is inspired by
two state-of-the-art approaches, namely \SCAMP{} and \CYCLON{}.

  \caption{\label{fig:cyclonexample}Example of \CYCLON{}'s periodic exchange of
    partial views. For simplicity sake, we set $|\mathcal{P}|$ to $4$ and the
    exchanges concern only $2$ neighbours. Furthermore, while the network
    contains $9$ members, we only show the partial views of $p_1$ and $p_5$.
    Peer $p_1$ initiates the view exchange with its oldest neighbour $p_5$,
    giving $\left\{p_1,\,p_2\right\}$. On receipt, Peer $p_5$ establishes the
    connection to $p_1$ and $p_2$ and gives away its connection to
    $\left\{p_6,\,p_9\right\}$.  On receipt of this latter, $p_1$ establishes
    the connection to Peer $p_6$ and Peer $p_9$. Altogether, we cut $4$ links
    to create $4$ other links only by using neighbour-to-neighbour
    interactions.}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Cyclon]\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon} is a periodic random peer sampling
  protocol which updates its partial view every interval of time. The partial
  view has a fixed-size set at start. In this view, each neighbour is
  associated with an age incremented at each cycle. To update its partial view,
  \CYCLON{} exchanges a subset of its partial view with one of its neighbour
  chosen using the age.  Assuming a well chosen $|\mathcal{P}|$, \CYCLON{}
  quickly converges to a random graph (cf. (REF experiments)) and quickly
  withdraws crashed/left peers.  Figure~\ref{fig:cyclonexample} depicts the
  periodic exchanges of \CYCLON{}. In particular, we can see that peers only
  communicate in their direct neighbourhood to renew the connections.

\begin{figure}

  \input{./input/scampexample.tex}
  \caption{\label{fig:scampexample} \SCAMP{}'s joining protocol on a small
    network with an identical legend to Figure~\ref{fig:cyclonexample}. Peer
    $p_1$ wants to join $p_2$'s network composed of $p_2$, $p_3$, $p_4$, and
    $p_5$. Let $\mathcal{P}_x$ denotes the partial view of Peer $p_x$. Peer
    $p_1$ establishes a connection to $p_2$. Then $p_2$ copies
    $|\mathcal{P}_2|$-times the new subscription and sends one to each
    neighbour. To handle possible failures, $c$ additional copies (here $0$ for
    simplicity sake), are sent to random neighbours. Then, each peer $p_x$ has
    a probability of $1\over{|\mathcal{P}_x|+1}$ to accept the forwarded
    subscription, hence, to establish a connection to reach $p_1$. Otherwise,
    the peer forwards it to another peer in $\mathcal{P}$ at random. Here,
    $p_3$ accepts the subscription, $p_5$ forwards it to $p4$, and the latter
    accepts it. The resulting graph is connected.}
\end{figure}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Scamp]\cite{ganesh2001scamp,ganesh2003peer} stands for SCalable
  Membership Protocol. This protocol links each membership event with an
  appropriate reaction.  The most important event is the joining event which
  creates a logarithmically increasing number of connections compared to the
  total network size.  Figure~\ref{fig:scampexample} depicts the joining
  protocol of \SCAMP{}. As we can see, the resulting graph is
  connected. However, the last peer $p_1$ only has one neighbour in its partial
  view, meaning that if $p_2$ crashes, $p_1$ cannot send messages to the
  network any more. To avoid that, a periodic re-subscription is
  necessary. This re-subscription mechanism will likely add new neighbours in
  the partial view of the newest peers and reorganise the neighbourhood of
  oldest peer. Just as \CYCLON{}, \SCAMP{} converges to a random graph
  providing desirable properties.
\end{asparadesc}

\subsection{Three-way handshake}
The recent WebRTC technology has allowed establishing peer-to-peer connections
directly inside modern web browser. In such context, the browsers use a
three-way handshake connection establishment instead of a more traditional
one-way connection. Thus, a subscription message must be
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item emitted at Peer $p$,
\item accepted at Peer $q$,
\item completed at Peer $p$.
\end{inparaenum}
Therefore, when a peer needs to establish a connection to another peer, a
message must travel back and forth. One could use a dedicated server to
establish the necessary dialog. However, this solution does not scale when
each peer in the network must repeatedly renew connections over time, which is
an expected behaviour of random peer sampling protocols. On the other hand,
using the built network itself to properly exchange the subscription messages
seems appropriate. Figure~\ref{fig:handshakeexample} depicts how it can be
performed in \CYCLON{} and \SCAMP{}. As we can see, \CYCLON{} subscription
messages always travel two hops away from their origin, while \SCAMP{}
subscription messages can travel longer ($k$ hops where $k$ is in average
$log(|\mathcal{N}|)$).  This difference deeply impacts performances of \SCAMP{}
as detailed hereafter, while \CYCLON{} suffers from other flaws.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{./input/handshakeexample.tex}
  \caption{\label{fig:handshakeexample}Handshaking differences of \CYCLON{} and
    \SCAMP{}. While subscriptions travel from $p_1$ to $p_3$ using one
    intermediate in \CYCLON{}, the subscriptions travel from $p_1$ to $p_k$ in
    \SCAMP{}. This difference change the complexity of the two approaches. In
    particular, the failure probability is much more important in
    \SCAMP{}. Indeed, links and peers, once employed, must be kept alive until
    the subscriptions travel back. Otherwise, the handshaking cannot be
    completed.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Motivations}
The establishment of connections using three-way handshaking forces a
round-trip negotiation much more costly and subject to failure compared to
one-way connection. In this context, each connection matters. Hence, we cannot
afford oversized partial views like in \CYCLON{}. For instance, considering an
application usable by small or large groups of users indifferently, \CYCLON{}
will overestimate to adapt to the largest groups. While this is indeed required
for these latter, the small groups of users will suffer of increased traffic
(oversized partial views maintenance, increased redundancy during the broadcast
of messages). If the group is small enough, the graph could be fully connected
which is highly undesirable.

As consequence, one would be tempted to use \SCAMP{} since it provides a
logarithmically growing number of connections compared to
$|\mathcal{N}|$. However, the \SCAMP{} subscription mechanism can create
connections several hops away from its origin
(cf. Figure~\ref{fig:handshakeexample}. Unfortunately, each of these hops is an
opportunity of failure.

Let $P_f$ the probability of either the peer or the link between the latter and
the next peer crashes/disconnects when it holds the subscription, without
possible recovery. Let $P_E$ the probability that a connection establishment
cannot be completed. Without three-way handshake, $P_E$ is straightforward:
\begin{equation} P_{E,\,1way}^{CYCLON}=1-(1- P_f)^2 \end{equation}
\begin{equation} P_{E,\,1way}^{SCAMP}=1-(1- P_f)^{k+1} \end{equation} where $k$
is the number of hops before the acceptance of the subscription, i.e., there
are $2$ hops at least. Indeed, the first peer cannot directly accept the
subscription. On the other hand, in the handshaking context, the subscription
must travel back to its origin in order to be completed. As consequence, when a
subscription travels through a peer or a link, they are not allowed to fail
until the subscription travels back. Thus, we obtain:
\begin{equation} P_{E,\,3way}^{CYCLON}=1-(1- P_f)^6\end{equation}
\begin{align} P_{E,\,3way}^{SCAMP} &=1 - ((1-P_f)^{2(k+1)} (1-P_f)^{2k}
                                     \ldots (1-P_f)^2) \nonumber \\
                                   &=1-(1-P_f)^{k^2+3k+2}
\end{align}
From these analysis, it is worth noting that while \CYCLON{} remains at a same
order of magnitude in both cases. On the other hand, \SCAMP{} is dramatically
impacted. 

%% To sustain these theoretical analysis, we conducted series of experiments to
%% highlight the differences between the contexts and the influence of failures
%% on convergence speed (INSERT GRAPH).

To summarise, we would like the best of the aforementioned approaches: a random
peer sampling protocol providing a logarithmically growing partial view size
compared to the network membership, using neighbour-to-neighbour interactions
to establish connections, quickly converging to a random network. Such protocol
would allow gossiping on top of WebRTC. Hence, it would open the gate to a wide
variety of distributed and decentralised applications requiring a scalable
broadcast.
