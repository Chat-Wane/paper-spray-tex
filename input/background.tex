\label{sec:background}

This section introduces the general outlines of the random peer sampling
protocols. Then, it details two state-of-the-art approaches that will be used
later on. Finally, we highlight the motivations of our approach.

\subsection{Random peer sampling}
Random peer sampling protocols (REF) provide each peer with a partial view
$\mathcal{P}$ of the network membership $N$. The partial views are populated
with a uniform distribution of randomly chosen peers. A wide variety of
gossip-based protocols use random peer sampling (e.g. topology management
(REF)). Nonetheless, providing each peer with a uniform random sample relying
solely on local knowledge remains challenging (REF?).  Our Scamplon protocol is
based on two state-of-the-art approaches, namely Scamp and Cyclon.

%% Talk about Cyclon
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Cyclon] (REF) is a periodic random peer sampling protocol which updates
  its partial view every interval of time. The partial view has a fixed-size
  set at start. In this view, each neighbour is associated with an age
  incremented at each cycle. To update its partial view, Cyclon exchanges a
  subset of its partial view with one of its neighbour chosen by using the
  age. The exchange guarantees that the network graph stays connected.
\end{asparadesc}

  \input{./input/cyclonexample.tex}
  \caption{\label{fig:cyclonexample}Example of Cyclon's periodic exchange of
    partial views. For simplicity sake, we set $|\mathcal{P}|$ to $3$ and the
    exchanges concern only $2$ neighbours. Furthermore, while the network
    contains $8$ members, we only show the partial views of $p_1$ and $p_5$.
    Peer $p_1$ initiates the view exchange with its oldest neighbour $p_5$,
    giving $\left\{p_1,\,p_4\right\}$. On receipt, Peer $p_5$ establishes the
    connection to $p_1$ and $p_4$ and gives away its connection to
    $\left\{p_7\right\}$.  On receipt of this latter, $p_1$ establishes the
    connection to Peer $p_7$. Altogether, we cut $3$ links to create $3$ other
    links only by using neighbour-to-neighbour interactions.  }
\end{figure}

%% Talk about Scamp
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Scamp] (REF) stands for SCalable Membership Protocol. It is a reactive
  protocol which provides each membership event with an appropriate reaction.

  Figure~\ref{fig:scampexample} depicts the joining protocol of Scamp. As we
  can see, the resulting graph is connected. However, the last peer $p_1$ only
  has one neighbour in its partial view, meaning that if $p_4$ crashes, $p_1$
  cannot send messages to the network any more. To avoid that, a periodic
  re-subscription is necessary.
\end{asparadesc}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{./input/scampexample.tex}
  \caption{\label{fig:scampexample} Scamp's joining protocol on a small
    network. Peer $p_1$ wants to join $p_4$'s network composed of $p_2$,
    $p_3$, $p_4$, and $p_5$. Peer $p_1$ establishes a connection to $p_4$. Then
    $p_4$ copies $|\mathcal{P}|$-times the new subscription and sends one to
    each neighbour. To handle possible failures, $c$ additional copies (here
    $0$ for simplicity sake), are sent to random neighbours. Then, each peer
    has a probability of $1\over{|\mathcal{P}|+1}$ to accept the forwarded
    subscription, hence, to establish a connection to reach $p_1$. Otherwise,
    the peer forwards it to another peer in $\mathcal{P}$ at random. Here,
    $p_3$ accepts the subscription, $p_2$ forwards it to $p5$, and the latter
    accepts it. The resulting graph is connected.}

In this paper, we do not restrict ourselves to the one-way connections. Instead,
we also study the effect of three-way handshake connection set-up.
