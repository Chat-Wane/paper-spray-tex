\label{sec:background}

This section introduces the general outline of the random peer sampling
protocols. Then, it details two state-of-the-art approaches that will be used
later on. Finally, we highlight the motivations of our approach.

\subsection{Random peer sampling}
Random peer sampling protocols provide each peer with a partial view
$\mathcal{P}$ of the network membership $N$. The partial views are populated
with a uniform distribution of randomly chosen peers. A wide variety of
gossip-based protocols use random peer sampling (e.g. topology management
(REF)). Nonetheless, providing each peer with a uniform random sample relying
solely on local knowledge remains challenging.  Our Scamplon protocol is based
on two state-of-the-art approaches, namely Scamp and Cyclon.

%% Talk about Cyclon
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Cyclon] is a periodic random peer sampling protocol which updates its
  partial view every interval of time. The partial view has a fixed-size set at
  start. In this view, each neighbour is associated with an age incremented at
  each cycle. To update its partial view, Cyclon exchanges a subset of its
  partial view with one of its neighbour chosen by using the age. The exchange
  guarantees that the network graph stays connected.
\end{asparadesc}

%% Talk about Scamp
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Scamp] stands for SCalable Membership Protocol. It is a reactive
  protocol which provides each membership event with an appropriate reaction.

  Figure~\ref{fig:scampexample} depicts the joining protocol of Scamp. As we
  can see, the resulting graph is connected. However, the last peer $p_1$ only
  has one neighbour in its partial view, meaning that if $p_4$ crashes, $p_1$
  cannot send messages to the network any more. To avoid that, a periodic
  re-subscription is necessary.
\end{asparadesc}

  \caption{\label{fig:scampexample} Scamp's joining protocol on a small
    network. Peer $p_1$ wants to join $p_4$'s network composed of $p_2$,
    $p_3$, $p_4$, and $p_5$. Peer $p_1$ establishes a connection to $p_4$. Then
    $p_4$ copies $|\mathcal{P}|$-times the new subscription and sends one to
    each neighbour. To handle possible failures, $c$ additionnal copies (here
    $0$ for simplicity sake), are sent to random neighbours. Then, each peer
    has a probability of $1\over{|\mathcal{P}|+1}$ to accept the forwarded
    subscription, hence, to establish a connection to reach $p_1$. Otherwise,
    the peer forwards it to another peer in $\mathcal{P}$ at random. Here,
    $p_3$ accepts the subscription, $p_2$ forwards it to $p5$, and the latter
    accepts it. The resulting graph is connected.}

In this paper, we do not restrict ourself to the one-way connections. Instead,
we also study the effect of three-way handshake connection set-up.
