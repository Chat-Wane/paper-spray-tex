\label{sec:background}

This section introduces the general outline of the random peer sampling
protocols. Then, it details two state-of-the-art approaches that will be used
later on. Finally, we highlight the motivations of our approach.

\subsection{Random peer sampling}
Random peer sampling protocols provide each peer with a partial view
$\mathcal{P}$ of the network membership $N$. The partial views are populated
with a uniform distribution of randomly chosen peers. Nonetheless, providing
each peer with a uniform random sample without global knowledge is challenging.
