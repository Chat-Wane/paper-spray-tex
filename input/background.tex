\label{sec:background}

Random peer sampling protocols~\cite{jelasity2004peer} provide each peer with a
partial view $\mathcal{P}$ of the network membership $\mathcal{N}$. They
populate the partial views with the reference of peers chosen at random among
$\mathcal{N}$ following a uniform distribution using local knowledge
only. Their goal is to converge to an overlay network exposing similar
properties of random graphs~\cite{erdos1959random}. They efficiently provide
connectedness, robustness, messages dissemination etc. A wide variety of
gossip-based protocols use random peer sampling (e.g. topology
management~\cite{voulgaris2005epidemic, jelasity2009tman, dabek2004vivaldi}).

Representatives of random peer sampling protocols~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon,
  eugster2003lightweight, tolgyeski2009adaptive} use a fixed-size partial view.
Thus, they have to know \emph{a priori} the maximum order of magnitude of the
network size to set their appropriate parameters. These decisions cannot be
safely retracted afterwards. For this reason, the partial views are commonly
oversized compared to the actual network size.

Figure (TODO) shows the theoretical number of arcs compared to
Cyclon~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon}'s number of arcs. In particular, we can
observe that the Cyclon's partial view is indifferent to network changes.  When
the partial views of Cyclon are oversized, the members of the network suffer of
increased traffic to maintain the membership and redundancy in broadcast. When
the partial views of Cyclon are undersized, the network becomes weaker to
massive failures.

(TODO Motivating example including WebRTC and mobile devices)

\begin{problem}
  Let $t$ be an arbitrary time frame, let $\mathcal{N}^t$ be the network
  membership at that given time $t$ and let $\mathcal{P}_x^t$ be the partial
  view of peer $p_x \in \mathcal{N}^t$.  A cost-efficient random peer sampling,
  especially when three-way handshaking is involved, should provide the
  following best-case properties:
  \begin{center}
    Partial view size: \hfill
    $\forall p_x \in \mathcal{N}^t,\, |\mathcal{P}_x^t| = \Theta (\ln
    |\mathcal{N}^t|)$
  \end{center}
  \begin{center}
    Connection establishment: \hfill $O(1)$
  \end{center}
  \begin{center}
    Convergence speed: \hfill $\Theta(\exp \, t^{-1})$
  \end{center}
\end{problem}

Unfortunately, while the properties of both approaches converge exponentially
fast to those of a random graph, each of them fails either on the partial view
size requirement (i.e. \CYCLON{}) or the time complexity of connection
establishment (i.e. \SCAMPLON{}). Knowingly, we would like the best of the
aforementioned approaches in order to answer to the problem
statement. Ultimately, it would allow cost-efficient gossiping on top of
WebRTC. Hence, it would open the gate to a wide variety of distributed and
decentralized applications requiring a scalable broadcast.
