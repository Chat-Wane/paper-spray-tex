\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced a random peer sampling approach called
\SCAMPLON{}.  This new approach, inspired of two state-of-the-art approaches,
namely \SCAMP{} and \CYCLON{}, provide the best of both worlds:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item logarithmically growing partial views compared to the global network
  size,
\item a quick convergence to a random graph
\item using neighbour-to-neighbour interactions.
\end{inparaenum}
As such, \SCAMPLON{} outperforms its parents in the context of 1-way connection
establishments. In addition, it greatly outperforms state-of-the-art in the
3-way handshake connection establishment set-up which becomes increasingly
important with recent technologies such as WebRTC that allows peer-to-peer
connection within modern browser. Since, random peer sampling constitutes the
ground of many decentralised applications.

Future work includes an analysis of the chosen size of exchanges in
\SCAMPLON{}. Indeed, currently, each peer choose a linear number of neighbours
to exchange compared to the size of partial view:
$\left\lceil |\mathcal{P}|\over{2} \right\rceil$. Nevertheless, the paper
introducing \CYCLON{} shows that a small subset of the partial view is enough
to provide a nearly optimal convergence speed. Thus, it lowers the network
overhead induced by the partial view exchanges at a relatively small price.

Future work also includes a Javascript implementation using WebRTC. While
experimentation of this paper shows the results of Peersim simulations, the
real implementation would open the gate to emulations, and even real
peer-to-peer decentralised applications (MOAR).
