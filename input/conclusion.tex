WebRTC opened a new playground for large-scale distributed applications
deployed on a network of browsers. Browsers as infrastructure ease the
deployment of large-scale distributed applications for end-users. As a core
component of many large-scale distributed applications, we pointed out current
peer sampling protocols' limitations in term of adaptivity or reliability.

In this paper, we described \SPRAY, an adaptative-by-design random peer
sampling approach designed to fit the WebRTC constraints.  \SPRAY provides:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item logarithmically growing partial views reflecting the global network size,
\item constant time complexity on connection establishments using solely
  neighbor-to-neighbor interactions.
% \item an exponentially fast convergence to an overlay network exposing
%   properties similar to random graphs.
\end{inparaenum}
In experiments, we demonstrated how \SPRAY adaptiveness improves random peer
sampling performances when network size is changing. In particular, the average
shortest path length scales better, the in-degree evolves with the network size,
and it converges faster.  Adaptiveness comes at the price of duplicates in the
partial views. However, our simulations supported by theoretical analysis show
that the number of duplicates remains very low and becomes negligible in large
networks.

To highlight the improvement brought by such protocol, we built \CRATE, a
decentralized collaborative editor directly accessible in web browsers. We
launched experiments involving uptill 600 browsers showing that message
dissemination highly benefits from adaptive neigbhorhoods. It allows building
scalable decentralized applications easily accessible, and which does not
require knowing the range of users nor their number.

Future work also includes investigations on topology managers such as
T-Man~\cite{jelasity2009tman} or Vicinity~\cite{voulgaris2005epidemic}. Indeed,
they traditionally rely on random peer sampling approaches using fixed-size
partial view. Thus, they maintain a fixed-size view of their most closely
related neighbors using a ranking function. With \SPRAY, we could extend their
behavior to use dynamic partial views.
