% WebRTC opened a new playground for large-scale distributed
% applications deployed on a network of browsers. Browsers as an
% infrastructure ease the deployment of large-scale distributed
% applications for end-users. Yet, WebRTC exacerbates the limitations,
% in term of adaptiveness and reliability, of a core component of many
% large-scale distributed applications: peer-sampling protocols.

In this paper, we described \SPRAY, an adaptive-by-design random peer sampling
approach designed to fit WebRTC's constraints.  \SPRAY provides:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item logarithmically growing partial views reflecting the global network size,
\item constant time complexity on connection establishments using solely
  neighbor-to-neighbor interactions.
% \item an exponentially fast convergence to an overlay network exposing
%   properties similar to random graphs.
\end{inparaenum}
Our experiments demonstrate how \SPRAY's adaptiveness improves the performance
of random peer sampling when the size of the network changes. In particular, the
average shortest path length scales better, the in-degree evolves with the
network size, and it converges faster.  Adaptiveness comes at the price of
duplicates in the partial views. However, our simulations supported by
theoretical analysis show that the number of duplicates remains very low and
becomes negligible in large networks.

To highlight the improvement brought by such protocol, we built \CRATE, a
decentralized collaborative editor directly accessible in web browsers. We
launched experiments involving up to 600 browsers showing that message
dissemination highly benefits from adaptive neighborhoods.

\SPRAY makes building scalable decentralized applications easy and accessible.
Developers do not require to oversee the network size targeted by their
applications. Just the same as for broadcast, many topology optimization
protocols (e.g. about geolocalization, latency, or preferences) rely on random
peer sampling protocol such as the generic algorithms
T-Man~\cite{jelasity2009tman} and Vicinity~\cite{voulgaris2005epidemic}. \SPRAY
allows such protocols to take benefict from its self-adjusting partial views.

% Future work includes investigations on topology managers such as
% T-Man~\cite{jelasity2009tman} or
% Vicinity~\cite{voulgaris2005epidemic}. Indeed, they traditionally rely
% on random peer sampling approaches using fixed-size partial
% view. Thus, they maintain a fixed-size view of their most closely
% related neighbors using a ranking function. With \SPRAY, we could
% extend their behavior to use dynamic partial views.
