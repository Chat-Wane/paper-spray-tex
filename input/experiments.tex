\section{Experimentation}
\label{sec:experiments}

In this section we evaluate how adaptivity of \SPRAY impact common
metrics of peer sampling performances including clustering
coefficient, average shortest path length, in-degree distribution, arc
counts, connected components. We use \CYCLON as baseline with a fixed
size view. We expect similar behavior when network size is optimal for
\CYCLON. We expect \SPRAY to save ressources when \CYCLON is
oversized. We expect \SPRAY to be more robust when \CYCLON is
undersized. Finally, we expect \SPRAY to keep number of duplicates in
partial view very low.

The experiments run on the \PEERSIM
simulator~\cite{montresor2009peersim}. The code of the random peer sampling
protocols \CYCLON, \SCAMP, and \SPRAY is available on Github
platform\footnote{https://github.com/justayak/peersim-spray}.

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To show that \SPRAY converges faster than fixed-size
  approaches. To show that \SPRAY and the state-of-the-art representative
  (\CYCLON) converge to an equivalent network overlay when the latter is
  optimally configured. To show that both approaches converge to values typical
  of random graphs.
\item[Description:] The average clustering coefficient $\overline{C}$ measures
  the connectivity of each peer's neighborhood in the network.
  \begin{equation}
    \overline{C} = {1\over |\mathcal{N}|}\sum\limits_{x\in\mathcal{N}}C_x
  \end{equation}
  where $C_x$ is the local clustering coefficient of Peer $p_x$.  The runs
  concern 0.1k, 1k, 10k and 100k peers. The representative of fixed-size
  approach is \CYCLON which is optimally configured for 1k peers. Indeed, its
  partial views are set to $\ln(1000)\approx 7$. During their exchange, the
  peers using \CYCLON shuffle $3$ out of their $7$ neighbors. Thus, \CYCLON
  is oversized for 0.1k peers and undersized for 10k peers and 100k peers.

  % The higher the coefficient, the more likely the network contains cliques.
  % To satisfy the random peer sampling objective it is desired that the
  % network
  % has
  % few clusters, thus has a sufficiently low clustering coefficient.  This is
  % important for various reasons. First, highly clustered networks show poor
  % load-balancing when messages are broadcast as peers have a high chance of
  % receiving a message multiple times through their neighbors. Second: a
  % network
  % consisting of poorly connected clusters is less robust regarding peers
  % failing or simply leaving the overlay to disconnect the graph.

\item[Results:] \TODO{Explain the starting values}. Figure~\ref{fig:clustering}
  shows that \SPRAY converges faster than \CYCLON. Furthermore, when the
  number of peers in the network grows, the convergence speed of \CYCLON
  suffers heavily. On the contrary, \SPRAY converges very quickly
  independently of the network size. Figure~\ref{fig:clustering} also shows
  that both the approaches converge to a low clustering coefficient which is
  characteristic of random graphs. Nevertheless, \CYCLON and \SPRAY do not
  raise the same values after convergence. Indeed, excepted the number of peers
  where \CYCLON is optimally configured, \SPRAY's values are either below
  (when \CYCLON is oversized) or above (when \CYCLON is undersized).
  Overall, it shows that \SPRAY is
  \begin{inparaenum}
  \item faster to converge to a clustering coefficient
  \item reflecting the needs of the network membership.
  \end{inparaenum}
  It impacts both load-balancing and robustness to churn (when peers join and
  leave the network freely).
\item[Reasons:] The fact that \CYCLON converges slower is due to its partial
  view and the size of the shuffle. When they are \emph{a priori} configured,
  they constitute a constraint to the convergence speed.  Next, the clustering
  coefficient measures how much the neighborhood of each peer is connected to
  the rest of the network. It directly depends of the partial view size of each
  peer which, in \CYCLON, is fixed. Thus, when the peers number is multiplied
  by $10$, the clustering coefficient after convergence is divided by $10$. On
  the other hand, the peers using \SPRAY have variable-size partial view which
  gently reflects the network size with a logarithmic growth. Thus, when the
  network has 1000 peers, the partial view size adapts to this network size. It
  explains the slightly lower clustering coefficient of \SPRAY on this run
  (\SPRAY 7.4 vs \CYCLON 7). By extending the reasoning, it explains the
  reasons of the \SPRAY lower value when \CYCLON is oversized, and the reasons
  of the \SPRAY higher value when \CYCLON is undersized.

\subsection{Average shortest path length}
\label{subsec:avg}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To show that the information dissemination is efficient in
  both \SPRAY and the fixed-size representative \CYCLON. \TODO{To show that
    \SPRAY scales better than \CYCLON in term of network size.}
\item[Description:] The average path length is the average of the shortest path
  length between peers in the graph. It counts the minimum number of hops to
  reach a peer from another given peer. It basically represents the traveling
  time of any information to reach all the peers at least once. We average the
  path length on a small subset of the network membership and run $100$ times
  the simulation on \SPRAY to avoid any side effects due to randomness. We also
  run the simulation on different configurations of \CYCLON targeting different
  optimal network size. \CYCLON set with the partial view size of 7 roughly
  targets 1.1k peers. \CYCLON set with the partial view size of 9 roughly
  targets 8.1k peers. \CYCLON set with the partial view size of 11 roughly
  targets 60k peers. In all these simulations, we perform the measurements
  after convergence. The checkpoints for the measurements are 0.1k, 0.5k, 1k,
  5k, 10k, 50k, and 100k peers.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:avgpath} shows that both \CYCLON and \SPRAY
  have an average shortest path length relatively small. Thus, the information
  can disseminate to all the network very quickly. Figure~\ref{fig:avgpath}
  also shows that, each run of \CYCLON taken alone can be divided in three
  parts compared to \SPRAY. First, an oversized \CYCLON disseminates the
  information faster than \SPRAY. Then, \SPRAY and \CYCLON are equivalent
  where the latter is optimally configured. Finally, \SPRAY yields better
  results. Yet, overall, \SPRAY scales better than \CYCLON since the
  gradient of the former is lower than any configuration of the latter one.
\item[Reasons:] We perform all the measurements after convergence where the
  network overlay is closely related to random graphs. In such graph, the the
  diameter and average shortest path length stay relatively small, as the
  resulting values shown in Figure~\ref{fig:avgpath}. The second observation
  concern each \CYCLON configuration compared alone with \SPRAY. While an
  oversized \CYCLON is much better connected into the graph and thus yields a
  lower average path length than \SPRAY, as soon as it is undersized,
  \SPRAY is, thanks to larger partial views, better connected into the graph.
  Consequently, it yields the shorter average path length. The overall
  observation is due to the fact that \SPRAY always follows the optimal
  value.

\end{figure*}


\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To show that the robustness of \SPRAY scales with the network
  size, contrarily to fixed-size partial view approaches. To show that the load
  balancing is independent of the network size and exposes equity among peers.
\item[Description:] The in-degree of a peer shows how well this peer is
  represented in others' partial view. The in-degree distribution of the
  network can highlight the existence of weakly connected peers and/or strongly
  connected hubs. It has a direct impact on robustness. In this experiment, the
  fixed-size partial view approach is \CYCLON{}. It is configured with partial
  views of size $7$ which is optimal for a network of roughly $1100$ peers.
  For all the experiments, we perform the in-degree measurements after
  convergence. The measurements concern networks with 0.1k, 1k, 100k, 500k
  peers.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:histo} shows the in-degree distribution of
  \CYCLON and \SPRAY. In the top figure, we observe that the distribution and
  the degrees of \CYCLON are identical, independently of the network
  size. Thus, the distribution of 0.1k peers is identical to the 500k one with
  a mean value of roughly 7 with a strong peak on this value. On the other
  hand, the bottom figure shows that the distribution of \SPRAY follows average
  partial view size which follows the network size
  growth. Figure~\ref{fig:histo} also shows that peers are very gathered around
  the mean partial view size. For instance, for the run with 500k peers using
  \SPRAY, the mean value for the in-degree is 13.37 and 88 percents of the
  peers have an in-degree comprised between 12 and 14 included. It means that
  the load is well balanced among peers. Since peers are equally important in
  term of connectedness, the network is robust to failures.
\item[Reasons:] Once configured, \CYCLON must handle any number of peers in the
  network with a fixed-size partial view. Proportionally, the number of times
  that a particular peer is referenced does not change compared to the network
  size. Indeed, the number of arcs that a new peer brings to network when it
  joins constitutes that much arcs targeting it after the shuffling
  rounds. Since the partial view size is constant, the in-degree of peers stays
  stable. On the other hand, in \SPRAY, each joining peer brings a increasing
  number of arcs in the network. Thus, the in-degree of each peer grows
  reflecting the network size. Hence, the distribution in the bottom figure
  shifts slowly to higher in-degree values as the network size grows.  \SPRAY
  does not peak on a particular value as \CYCLON because the average partial
  view size for a particular network size falls in-between integer values. For
  instance, if the average partial view size is 6.5, then half of them will
  have a size of 6 while the other half will have a size of 7. Such network is
  robust to failure because no peer is more important than other in term of
  connectedness. Therefore, if some random peer crashes, it will not affect as
  much the network as if a peer strongly connected crashed.

\subsection{Dynamic network}

%     peers join the network at cycles $0$, $10$, $20$, and $30$. Then 5k peers
%     leave at cycle $40$. Finally 2.5k peers join at cycles $60$ and $70$. The
%     final network contains 10k members.}
% \end{figure}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To highlight that \SPRAY is able to adapt to reflect the
  dynamic changes of membership in the network. To show that the arcs are
  quickly spread among the members. To confirm the relationship between \SPRAY
  and the proactive aggregation~\cite{jelasity2004epidemic}.
\item[Description:] In this experiment we focus on a dynamic network where
  peers can join and leave. We also focus on the \SPRAY protocol. The first
  half of the experimentation, 2.5k peers are added 4 times successively by
  intervals of 10 cycles each. Thus, the network size goes from 0 to 10k peers
  in 40 rounds. Then, half of the network leaves without giving notice (5k
  peers). Finally, 2.5k peers join two additional times. The final network size
  is 10k members. The measurements concern
  \begin{inparaenum}
  \item the number of connections in the network over cycles,
  \item the variance of the partial view sizes over cycles
    (cf. Section~\ref{subsec:cyclic}).
  \end{inparaenum}
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:churn} shows the result of the experiment. The
  x-axis represents the cycles (i.e. the arbitrary unit time frame). The top
  figure shows the number of connections established in the network (scale
  $\times 10^3$). The bottom figure shows the variance in the partial view size
  of the members. We can see that at each batch of joinings, the connection
  number grows to reflect the needs of the new network membership. The
  observation is consistent with the variance measures. Indeed, at each batch
  of insertions, the variance suddenly grows. Then, it exponentially decreases
  and converges to zero in less than 10 cycles. The variance is higher when the
  network size is lower. For instance, the first 2.5k peers lead to the highest
  variance. At the $40^{th}$ cycle, half of the peers leave/crash. Around half
  of the connections are directly removed without disturbing the variance of
  partial views. The 10 following cycles show a slight decrease of
  connections. Then new members are introduced in the network yielding the same
  results as earlier joinings.
\item[Reasons:] Since the partial views of \SPRAY adapt themselves to the
  network size, the number of connections grows as the network membership
  grows.  The peaks in variance correspond to the joining parts of the
  experiment. The disparity comes from the fact that new peers arrive in the
  network with a small partial view. The peaks are smaller when the network is
  larger. Indeed, the peers - which already were network members before the new
  arrivals - had a few cycles to exchanges and even up their partial views. As
  consequence, it lessens the weight of joinings. The removal of 5k peers does
  not disturb the variance since each crashing/leaving peer is chosen at
  random. Thus, no peers suffer more of these removals than others. The
  slightly decreasing number of arcs after the removal is due to peers
  realizing that some arcs are dead, leading to a probabilistic removal
  (cf. Algorithm~\ref{algo:unreachable}).

% \caption{\label{algo:unsubscription}Unsubscription protocol from
%   \SCAMP~\cite{ganesh2003peer}}
% \end{algorithm}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To show that both \SPRAY and \CYCLON are robust to massive
  \TODO{random} failures. To highlight that even if the information
  dissemination fails to reach all peers, the membership protocols are still
  able to repair the network, until the failure is beyond repair.
\item[Description:] Counting the strong components in a network allows
  estimating the area that are reachable by the information dissemination
  protocols. For instance, there are 2 strong components if a part of the
  network can reach another part and the converse being false.  Counting the
  weak components in a network allows estimating the point where the network is
  still in a repairable state, i.e., after some shufflings, the network will
  converge to an overlay where the information dissemination is able to reach
  all members again. \CYCLON has a partial view size set to 9. The network
  contains 10k members. We perform the removals after the approaches converged
  to a stable overlay network. We remove the batch of peers at once, from 25 to
  95 percents of peers every 5 percents, i.e., 16 runs for each approach. We
  perform a last measurement at 99 percents. We perform the measurements
  immediately after the removals. The removals concern a percentage of the
  peers chosen at random among the 10k members.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} shows the ratio of strong/weak
  components over the network size after removals. Firstly, the figure shows
  that both the random peer sampling protocols \SPRAY and \CYCLON suffer from
  deteriorated behavior at high removal percentages, \CYCLON being slightly
  better in this term. Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} shows that the information
  dissemination (strong components) starts to slowly degrade at 45 percents,
  and quickly degrade at 70 percents. Fortunately, Figure~\ref{fig:resilience}
  also shows that the approaches are able to recover from such clustering until
  high removal rate. Indeed, the weak components start to increase at 70
  percents. Meaning that some part of the network are completely disjoint and
  beyond repair.
\item[Reasons:] The random peer sampling approaches \CYCLON and \SPRAY expose
  very similar results because \CYCLON's configuration targets a network size
  of 10k peers, while \SPRAY adjusts itself automatically to this network size.
  Therefore, the arcs number in the approaches are close from being identical
  (\TODO{SIZE}). \CYCLON is slightly better because, in this case, it has more
  arcs (due to \SPRAY's randomness) and because it does not have duplicates
  (\SPRAY contains a small amount of duplicates in the partial view,
  cf. Section~\ref{subsec:duplicates}). It requires a high amount of removals
  to endanger the information dissemination protocol's ability to reach all
  peers. Indeed, since all peers are equally important in the network
  (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:histo}), removing a particular peer does not
  greatly affect the whole network. The network membership protocol is able to
  repair the topology later than the information dissemination starts to fail
  because the direction of arcs is not as important as in the latter. Indeed,
  \CYCLON and \SPRAY are still able to repair a network until parts of the
  network become disjoint, i.e., there is no arc between these parts of the
  network.

% \subsection{Degeneration}

% \begin{figure}
%   \centering \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{img/degen.eps}
%   \caption{\label{fig:degen}Degeneration of static network} \end{figure}

% \begin{asparadesc}
% \item[Objective:] \SPRAY{}, especially when using \emph{handshaking}, is
%   vulnerable to message loss. When messages can be lost, a static \SPRAY{}
%   overlay where peers neither join nor leave will slowly degenerate.  The
%   reason for this can be found in Algorithm~\ref{algo:unreachable} where arcs
%   are potentially lost when a message is lost.  Protocols with fixed partial
%   view sizes like \CYCLON{} are not prone to this degeneration as they can
%   easily repair lost arcs.  For this reason, we compare with another adaptive
%   probabilistic protocol, \SCAMP{}, instead. We adapted \SCAMP{} so that its
%   lease-mechanism preserves the total number of arcs in the network.  This
%   experiment focuses on two features: the total number of arcs in the graph
%   and the number of weak components.
% \item[Description:] As previously shown, the number of arcs in the network
%   should be $|\mathcal{N}|\log{|\mathcal{N}|}$ for the overlay to be
%   robust. A weak component $\mathcal{W}$ of a graph $G$ is a maximum subgraph
%   where the direction is ignored.  Naturally, we want the number of weak
%   components $|\mathcal{W}|$ to be $1$, meaning that the whole network is
%   connected.  When the overlay consists of more than one component, the
%   network is disconnected.  Unlike with strong component where the direction
%   is taken into account, \SPRAY{} cannot repair itself when more than one
%   weak component is present.  The experiment involves handshaking and is
%   conducted with an overlay consisting of $10,000$ peers over a period of
%   $100,000$ cycles and a probability of $\frac{1}{1000}$ that a link
%   fails. \TODO{Moar on calcs}
% \item[Results:] The x-axis in Figure~\ref{fig:degen} shows the number of
%   cycles the protocol was executed.  The upper graphs y-axis represents the
%   total number of arcs in the overlay while the lower graphs y-axis shows the
%   percentage that weak components make up of the total network:
%   $\frac{|\mathcal{W}|}{|\mathcal{N}|}$.  We clearly see that \SPRAY{}
%   degenerates much slower than \SCAMP{} and that it becomes disconnected very
%   late while \SCAMP{} collapses quickly.
% \item[Reasons:] As \SCAMP{} must maintain much more links than \SPRAY{} when
%   establishing a connection it has a higher probability of losing arcs which,
%   in turn, let it degenerate much quicker.  Furthermore, while in \SPRAY{} we
%   can easily predict if a link failed or if the node failed and thus we can
%   stop the degeneration this is not possible in \SCAMP{} as it cannot be
%   predicted easy for when a link failed due to its random walk nature.

\subsection{Duplicates in partial views}
\label{subsec:duplicates}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{img/duplicates.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:duplicates}Duplicates in networks of different size: the
    $\log_{10}$-scaled x-axis denotes the network size while y-axis denotes the
    proportion of peers without any duplicates in their partial view.}
\end{figure}

\begin{asparadesc} 
\item[Objective:] To show that the number of peer containing duplicates in
  their partial view is always low.  To show that this proportion becomes minor
  in large networks. To highlight the relation between the birthday paradox and
  the proportion of duplicates.

  %% Put that in proposal maybe:
  % \SPRAY's only constraint for a peers partial view is that it must not
  % contain
  % self-loops, however, multiple links to the same peer different from oneself
  % are explicitly allowed.  This characteristic strongly distinguishes \SPRAY
  % from \CYCLON and other \emph{random peer sampling services} who ensure that
  % only one link per peer exists.  We want to avoid duplicates in partial
  % views
  % for two obvious reasons: First, it lowers the robustness: when a peer $a$
  % references another peer $b$ multiple times and peer $b$ leaves the network
  % than $a$ will lose not one but multiple links and thus making \SPRAY
  % potentially more disruptive than its sibling protocols.  Second, duplicates
  % might be problematic for protocols that make use of \SPRAY as a random peer
  % sampling service. When used for broadcasting, unnecessary messages are sent
  % which increases the network costs of the protocol.  All of this demands a
  % closer look on the behavior of duplicates.
\item[Description:] Using \SCAMP as random peer sampling protocol, we measure
  the amount of peers which have a partial view containing at least one
  duplicated reference. We perform the measurements on networks containing
  0.1k, 1k, 10k, 100k, and 500k peers. We measure the number of duplicates
  after convergence. We put this in relation with a theoretical approximation
  from the birthday paradox. The probability of a peer to not have duplicates
  is approximately:
  \begin{equation}
    1- 
    (1-
    \exp({-\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)*(\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)-1)\over{2*|\mathcal{N}|}}))
  \end{equation}
  % The experiment is conducted with networks of different
  % size, ranging form 1000 to 1 million peers that all join at the same
  % moment. We then examine the convergence of duplicates in the overlay, the
  % results can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dupl}: The x-axis denotes the
  % elapsed
  % time in cycles while the y-axis denotes the share of nodes that contain
  % duplicate links in their partial view.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:duplicates} shows the proportion of peers using
  a partial view containing duplicates. As we can observe, there always exist
  partial views with at least one duplicate. The proportion is more important
  when the network size is small (e.g. 5 percents for 0.1k peers), and it
  becomes a minor overhead when the network size is larger (e.g. less than 1
  percent for 10k peers). The birthday paradox approximation seems to follow
  very closely the experimental results. It empirically confirms that there
  exist a relation between the duplicates and the birthday paradox. The
  proportion of peers without duplicates tends to 100 percents as the network
  size grows.
\item[Reasons:] As the network grows, the chances of a particular peer to have
  at least twice the reference to another peer becomes smaller. Indeed, while
  the network grows linearly, the number of references to a particular peer
  only grows logarithmically. Nevertheless, the birthday paradox reminds that
  this proportion is not as small as it seems to be.
