\section{Experimentation}
\label{sec:experimentation}


In this section, we evaluate how the adaptiveness of \SPRAY impacts common
metrics of peer-sampling performance including clustering coefficient, average
shortest path length, in-degree distribution, robustness, and arc count. We
compare \SPRAY with a representative of fixed-size partial view approaches,
namely \CYCLON. We expect \SPRAY and \CYCLON to exhibit similar behaviors when
\CYCLON is configured in advance to the logarithm of the targeted network
size. We expect \SPRAY to save resources when \CYCLON provides larger views, and
to be more robust when \CYCLON provides smaller views. We expect \SPRAY-based
network size estimators to provide an estimate at least accurate enough to
inform about the order of magnitude of the actual network size.  Finally, we
expect \SPRAY to keep a negligible number of duplicates in its partial views. We
also evaluate the impact of the WebRTC connection establishment on \CYCLON,
\SCAMP, and \SPRAY, in networks subject to message loss.  We expect a normal
behavior for \CYCLON and \SPRAY while \SCAMP becomes quickly partitioned.

The experiments run on the \PEERSIM simulator~\cite{montresor2009peersim}, a
well-known program written in Java that allows simulations to reach high scale
in terms of number of peers. Our implementation of the evaluated random
peer-sampling protocols is available on the Github
platform\footnote{\url{https://github.com/justayak/peersim-spray}}.


\subsection{Clustering and convergence time}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To observe how adaptiveness impacts clustering and convergence
  time.
\item[Description:] The average local clustering
  coefficient~\cite{watts1998collective} measures peers' neighborhood
  connectivity in the network:
  \begin{equation*}
    \overline{C} = {1\over |V^t|}\sum\limits_{x\in V^t}C_x
  \end{equation*}
  where $C_x$ is the local clustering coefficient of Peer $p_x$. The higher the
  coefficient, the more peers are tied together. The coefficient of complete
  graphs is 1. The coefficient of random graphs is close to 0.  

  For each approach, the experiment comprises 4 runs respectively building a
  network of 0.1k, 1k, 10k, and 100k peers. Peers join the network at
  once. Peers join the network through a contact peer chosen at random following
  a uniform distribution. 
  
  For the sake of fairness, we configure the representative of
  fixed-size approaches, \CYCLON, to provide $7$ neighbors which is
  close to the number of neighbors provided by \SPRAY when the network
  size reaches 1k peers ($\ln(1000)\approx 7$). Compared to \SPRAY,
  \CYCLON is oversized for 0.1k peers and undersized for 10k peers and
  100k peers. During exchanges, the peers using \CYCLON shuffle $3$
  out of their $7$ neighbors.

  % The representative of the fixed-size approach is \CYCLON which is configured
  % for 1k peers: $\ln(1000)\approx 7$ neighbors.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\SCALE\columnwidth]{img/clustering.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:clustering}Clustering coefficient.}
\end{figure}

\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:clustering} shows that \CYCLON starts with a
  lower clustering coefficient than \SPRAY.  Yet, \CYCLON and \SPRAY have
  roughly similar convergence time, for it converges exponentially fast.
  Figure~\ref{fig:clustering} also shows that both approaches converge to a low
  clustering coefficient which is characteristic of random graphs. Nevertheless,
  \CYCLON and \SPRAY do not reach the same values after convergence. Except when
  the network comprises 1k peers, \SPRAY's values are either below when \CYCLON
  is comparatively oversized; or above when \CYCLON is comparatively undersized.
  
  These results show that both \SPRAY and \CYCLON can be deployed at once. They
  start ready-to-use but do not have their optimal properties. However, no
  matter the size of the deployment, they will obtain these properties very
  quickly.

\item[Reasons:] Peers join one after the other in 1 round. Peers join using a
  contact peer chosen at random among already connected peers. Therefore, old
  peers are chosen more often during this starting round. In the starting
  topology, old peers are more clustered than newest ones. In particular, since
  \SPRAY does not enforce a limit on the size of partial views, oldest peers
  have larger partial views than newest peers. Thus, oldest peers are more tied
  together. Consequently, \SPRAY starts with a higher clustering coefficient
  than \CYCLON. 

  The clustering coefficient measures how much peer's neighbors are connected
  together. It directly depends on the partial view size of each peer which, in
  \CYCLON, is constant. Thus, when the number of peers is multiplied by $10$,
  the clustering coefficient after convergence is divided by $10$. On the other
  hand, peers using \SPRAY have a partial view the size of which reflects the
  network size. When the network has 1k peers, \SPRAY and \CYCLON have roughly
  the same average partial view size (\SPRAY $7.1$ vs \CYCLON $7$), hence almost
  identical clustering coefficient measurements. By extending the reasoning,
  this also explains why \SPRAY yields lower $\overline{C}$ values when \CYCLON
  is comparatively oversized, and why it yields higher values when \CYCLON is
  comparatively undersized.
\end{asparadesc}


\subsection{Information dissemination}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To observe how adaptiveness impacts the average shortest path
  length, i.e., the speed of information dissemination.
\item[Description:] The average path length is the average of the shortest path
  length between peers in the graph. It counts the minimum number of hops to
  reach a peer from another given peer. It basically represents the traveling
  time of any information to reach all the peers at least once. We average the
  path length on a subset of the network membership.

  We run the simulation on \SPRAY $100$ times to avoid any side effects due to
  randomness. The experiment comprises 3 runs for \CYCLON: we set \CYCLON to
  provide $7$ neighbors which is close to the number of neighbors provided by
  \SPRAY when the network reaches 1k peers; we set \CYCLON to provide 9
  neighbors which is close to the number of neighbors provided by \SPRAY when
  the network reaches 8k peers; we set \CYCLON to provide 11 neighbors which is
  close to the number of neighbors provided by \SPRAY when the network reaches
  60k peers. We perform the measurements after convergence. The checkpoints for
  the measurements are 0.1k, 0.5k, 1k, 5k, 10k, 50k, and 100k peers.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\SCALE\columnwidth]{img/avgpath.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:avgpath}Average shortest path length.}
\end{figure}

\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:avgpath} shows that both \CYCLON and \SPRAY have
  a relatively small average shortest path length.  Figure~\ref{fig:avgpath}
  also shows that each run of \CYCLON is divided in three parts compared to
  \SPRAY. \CYCLON starts with smaller values than \SPRAY. \SPRAY and \CYCLON
  become equivalent when the latter is configured to the logarithm of the actual
  network size. After this point, \SPRAY has smaller values than
  \CYCLON. Overall, \SPRAY scales better than \CYCLON since the gradient (slope)
  of the former is lower than any configuration of the latter. Empirically, we
  observe that \CYCLON builds networks with an average shortest path length of
  $\smash{\ln(|V^t|)\over {\ln(|P|)}}$ where $|P|$ is constant, while \SPRAY
  builds networks with an average shortest path length of
  $\smash{\ln(|V^t|)\over{\ln(\ln(|V^t|))} }$.

  These results show that developers could use both \SPRAY and \CYCLON to build
  efficient information dissemination protocols. Nevertheless, they should use
  \SPRAY over \CYCLON if their concerns are about latency and the network size
  is unknown or can change over time.

\item[Reasons:] We performed the measurements after convergence. After
  convergence, the network overlay become closely related to random graphs. In
  particular, the diameter and average shortest path length remain small.

  Before reaching the point where the number of neighbors provided by \SPRAY is
  equivalent to the number of neighbors provided by \CYCLON, \CYCLON provides
  more neighbors than \SPRAY. Since the number of arcs is greater, it yields a
  lower average path length. Conversely, when the number of peers in the network
  goes over the point where \SPRAY and \CYCLON are equivalent, \SPRAY provides
  more neighbors than \CYCLON. Therefore, the lower average path length is
  smaller using \SPRAY. Overall, \SPRAY scales better than any configuration of
  \CYCLON, for it adds arcs as the network grows.

\subsection{Load-balancing}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To observe how adaptiveness impacts the in-degree
  distribution, i.e., the load-balancing among peers.
\item[Description:] The in-degree of a peer shows how well it is represented in
  others' partial views. The in-degree distribution of the network can highlight
  the existence of weakly connected peers and strongly connected hubs. These
  peers have an in-degree far from the average in-degree value. It directly
  impacts robustness, for few crashes or departures may disconnect a weakly
  connected peer; and disconnections of hubs deeply impact the rest of the
  network.

  For each approach, the experiment comprises 4 runs respectively building a
  network of 0.1k, 1k, 100k, and 500k peers. We configure \CYCLON with partial
  views of size $7$ which is close to the number of neighbors provided by \SPRAY
  when the network reaches 1k peers.  We perform the in-degree measurements
  after convergence.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\SCALE\columnwidth]{img/histo.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:histo}In-degree distribution.}
\end{figure}

\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:histo} shows the in-degree distribution of
  \CYCLON and \SPRAY. The x-axis denotes the in-degree. The y-axis denotes the
  percentage of peers with such in-degree in the network. The top part of
  Figure~\ref{fig:histo} focuses on \CYCLON. We observe that the in-degree
  distributions are identical independently of the network size. For instance,
  the distribution of 0.1k peers is identical to the one of 500k peers. The mean
  value is roughly 7 and we observe a strong peak on this value. On the other
  hand, the bottom part of Figure~\ref{fig:histo} focuses on \SPRAY. We observe
  that the distribution of \SPRAY follows the average partial view size, which
  itself follows the growth of the size of the network.

  Figure~\ref{fig:histo} also shows that peers are very gathered around the mean
  partial view size for both \SPRAY and \CYCLON. For instance, for the run with
  500k peers using \SPRAY, the mean in-degree value is 13.37 and 88\% of peers
  have an in-degree between 12 and 14 included. Even the highest in-degree value
  18 is not far from the average in-degree. Thus, there are no weakly connected
  peers nor strongly connected hubs.

  These results show that both \SPRAY and \CYCLON are resilient to random
  failures, for peers are equally important in terms of connectedness. These
  results also show that developers could use both \SPRAY and \CYCLON to build
  dissemination protocols that would balance the download among peers. Using
  \SPRAY, the download would increase and decrease following the fluctuations in
  network size.

\item[Reasons:] Once configured, \CYCLON must handle any number of peers in the
  network with a fixed-size partial view and since the partial view size is
  constant, the in-degree of peers stays stable.  On the other hand, in \SPRAY,
  each joining peer brings an increasing number of arcs in the network. Thus,
  the in-degree of peers slowly grows reflecting the network size. Hence, the
  distribution in the bottom part of Figure~\ref{fig:histo} shifts slowly to
  higher in-degree values as the network size grows.

  \SPRAY does not peak on a particular value as \CYCLON does because the average
  partial view size for a particular network size may fall in-between integer
  values. For instance, if peers using \SPRAY have partial views that contain
  6.5 neighbors on average, it means that half these peers have 6 neighbors
  while the other half have 7 (out-degree). As consequence, the average
  in-degree value will also be 6.5. However, while \SPRAY and \CYCLON constrain
  the size of partial views respectively to the average and to a constant value,
  they do not constrain the size of in-views, hence the distributions of
  Figure~\ref{fig:histo}.

\subsection{Adaptive partial views}

\caption{Partial view size measurements in networks subject to churn.}
\end{figure*}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Objective:] To show that using \SPRAY, the partial views grow and shrink
  logarithmically compared to the network size.
  %% To show that \SPRAY is non-deterministic
\item [Description:] In this experiment we focus on dynamic networks where peers
  can join and leave. In this experiment, we create 4 networks that vary from 50
  to 100 peers, from 500 to 1k peers, from 5k to 10k peers, and 50k to 100k
  peers. First, we create a network of half the maximum targeted size. Second,
  we repeatedly inject then disconnect half the maximum targeted size in periods
  of 240 cycles including a 40 cycles break in between injection and
  disconnection phases. For instance, in the network the size of which varies
  from 50k to 100k, 500 peers join the network at each cycle during the
  injection phases until it reaches 100k peers; then 40 cycles last; then 500
  peers leave the network at each cycle during the disconnection phases until it
  reaches 50k peers, and so on. During the experiments, we measure the maximum,
  the minimum, the average, and the standard deviation of the size of partial
  views.
\item [Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:small} focuses on the first 680 rounds of the
  experiment about the network varying from 5k to 10k peers. The top part of the
  figure shows the number of peer over time. The bottom part of the figure shows
  the measurements made on partial views. We observe that 
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
    \item partial views grow logarithmically when the network size increases;
    \item partial views shrink logarithmically when the network size shrinks;
    \item while the extreme values of partial view size are spread during
      joining phases (from 1 to 12), standard deviation remains small, meaning
      that most of peers have the same partial view size.
  \end{inparaenum}
  Figure~\ref{fig:extended} shows the results of the 4 runs over 28k cycles,
  i.e., 100 injection/removal phases. The x-axis denotes the time in cycles. The
  y-axis denotes the average partial view size of peers. We observe
  that 
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item the average partial view size does not necessarily fit exactly the theoretical
    expectation;
  \item the average partial view size varies even for a network reaching the
    same number of peers;
  \item variations are more important as the number of peers is lower.
  \end{inparaenum}

  These results show that developers could use \SPRAY to deploy protocols such
  as distributed hash tables~\cite{camarillo2014self} or routing
  protocols~\cite{kleinberg2000smallworld} that could benefit from random
  peer-sampling protocols properties and that normally require the use of
  network-size estimators to work.

  % The estimate provided by \SPRAY is not precise but comes
  % at no cost while network-size estimators involve traffic.

\item [Reasons:] A peer joining the network injects at least one arc plus a
  number of arcs depending on the contact peer. Since we choose the contact peer
  at random, and the partial views are averaged over shuffles, this number of
  injected arcs is the average partial view size on average. It leads to a
  logarithmic progression of the number of arcs. However, the peer joining the
  network only have one peer in its partial view while adding more arcs to its
  contact's neighborhood. Since we choose the contact peer at random, it may be
  chosen multiple times during 1 cycle which increases quickly its neighbors'
  number of arcs above the average. Consequently, we observe a large difference
  between the minimum and the maximum, but the standard deviation remains
  low. The latter is even more lowered after shuffling, for it makes partial
  views converge to their average size. 

  When a peer leaves the network, there is a logarithmic number of peers that
  detect the departure. They probabilistically duplicate an arc in such manner
  that one of them do not. Overall, it removes a logarithmic number of arcs plus
  one which correspond to the number of arcs injected during the latest
  joining. Consequently, the partial views shrink logarithmically when the
  network size diminishes.

  If we choose multiple time a same contact peer, its neighbors' number of arcs
  increases above the average. If one of these neighbors is chosen as contact
  peer before any shufflings, the global number of arcs increases too
  quickly. On the other hand, we may choose the newest peers as contact node
  hence increasing the number of arc too slowly, for they have fewer
  neighbors. Depending on these choices, the average partial view size can grow
  too high or too low compared to the theoretical value. Yet, it remains
  logarithmic, for these choices are made at random following a uniform
  distribution. These choices are more influential when the network size is low,
  for any addition or removal of arcs is proportionally more important.
\end{asparadesc}

\subsection{Network-size estimation}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Objective:] To show the accuracy of \SPRAY's partial views when used as a
  network-size estimator.
\item [Description:] To evaluate the accuracy of \SPRAY as a
  network-size estimator, we define estimation quality as the ratio of
  measured estimations to the actual network size. This allows us to
  see how far from the actual network size the estimation can be.  In
  our experiment, peers use \SPRAY and join the network by groups of
  1k peers until the network reaches a size of 100k peers. We evaluate
  two estimators based on the partial views of \SPRAY. The first
  estimator uses the local partial view only.  \SPRAY provides a peer
  $x$ with a view of size $|P^t_x| \approx \ln(|V^t|)$. To estimate
  the network size, peer $x$ processes:
  \begin{equation*}
    \widehat{V^t}= \exp{(|P^t_x|)}
  \end{equation*}
  The second estimator uses the local partial view and asks for the neighbors'
  partial view size. Peer $x$ averages the values and computes the estimate:
  \begin{equation*}
    \widehat{V^t} = \exp({ {|P^t_x| + \sum_{i \in P^t_x} {|P^t_i|}} \over{|P^t_x|+1} })
  \end{equation*}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\SCALE\columnwidth]{img/estimator.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:estimator}Quality of network-size estimation.}
\end{figure}

\item [Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:estimator} shows mean and standard
  deviation of the estimation quality with increasing network
  sizes. We observe that the estimation quality depends on the network
  size. Using local knowledge only, most peers are able to compute an
  estimation ranging from $\pm 10\%$ to $\pm 30\%$ of the actual
  network size. We also observe that increasing the available
  knowledge using peers' neighborhoods improves the estimation by
  decreasing the variation of estimates around the mean (from $\pm
  5\%$ to $\pm 10\%$).

  These results show empirically that applications that need to
  estimate the network size can use \SPRAY's partial view size as
  input to know the order of magnitude of the actual network size. The
  use of local knowledge only leads to an inaccurate estimate but it
  comes at no cost while full-fledged network-size estimators generate
  traffic~\cite{montresor2004robust}. Applications can easily increase
  accuracy on-demand by asking their neighbors for their partial view
  sizes for a limited cost.

\item [Reasons:] The standard deviation of the estimation quality
  grows and shrinks while the network size increases, particularly in
  the case of local-only knowledge. Figure~\ref{fig:estimator} shows
  that the variance of estimates narrows before quickly raising at
  increasingly sized intervals.  Since the size of views is an integer
  value, the logarithm of the estimation for a peer at a given time
  can be off by 1.  For instance, when the network reaches 65k peers,
  the average partial view size just starts to go above 11, meaning
  that some peers have 12 neighbors in their partial views. Since the
  local-knowledge estimation of a peer $x$ is $\smash{\widehat{V^t_x}
    = \exp(|P^t_x|)}$, increasing peer $x$'s view size by $1$ results
  in a much larger estimate. Hence the sudden increase in standard
  deviation at such network sizes. The standard deviation decreases as
  the actual network size approaches the overestimated size.
 
  This effect can be mitigated by averaging the local value with the
  neighbors' partial view sizes: the computed value is no longer an
  integer but an aggregation of representative values chosen at
  random.
\end{asparadesc}

\subsection{Robustness}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To show \SPRAY's robustness to failures.
\item[Description:] To evaluate robustness, we count the number of weakly and
  strongly connected components of the network. Counting strong components
  allows us to estimate the effectiveness of information dissemination protocols
  built on top of random peer-sampling protocols. For example, with two strong
  components, bidirectional communication between the two components cannot be
  achieved. The first strong component may be able to reach the second, but the
  second may not reach the first. However, the network remains in a repairable
  state, for at least one link units these components. After some shuffling, the
  two strong components add links to each other. Thus, the two strong components
  merge into one. Therefore, counting the weak components allows us to estimate
  to what extent the network can be repaired, i.e., two weak components exist
  when there is no link to unit them.

  In our experiment, we configure \CYCLON's view size to 9 which is
  approximately equivalent to \SPRAY's view size when the network reaches 8k
  peers. The network contains 10k members. We perform the removals after the
  approaches have converged to a stable overlay network. We remove a random set
  of peers at once following a uniform distribution. We remove from 25 to 95
  percent of peers every 5 percents, i.e., 16 runs for each approach. We perform
  a last measurement at 99 percent. We measure the number of components
  immediately after each removal.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\SCALE\columnwidth]{img/resilience.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:resilience}Robustness to massive failures.}
\end{figure}

\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} shows the robustness of \SPRAY and
  \CYCLON to massive random failures. The x-axis denotes the percentage of peers
  removed at once. The y-axis denotes the ratio of strong/weak components over
  the network size after removals. First, Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} shows that
  both the random peer-sampling protocols \SPRAY and \CYCLON suffer from
  deteriorated behavior at high removal percentages, \CYCLON being slightly
  better in this term. Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} shows that the number of
  strong components starts to increase at 45 percents and to quickly increase at
  70 percents. Hence, the information dissemination starts to degrade at 45
  percents of removals: messages broadcast by some peers cannot reach all peers.
  Fortunately, Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} also shows that the approaches are
  able to recover from dire state until high removal ratio. Indeed, the number
  of weak components starts to increase at 70 percents of removals, meaning that
  there is no link between some parts of the network to unit them. In other
  terms, some parts of the network became completely disjoint. Shuffling cannot
  be initiated between members of each other disjoint parts. Consequently, the
  network cannot fully repair itself above 70 percents of removals.

  These results show that both \SPRAY and \CYCLON fit contexts such as the
  internet where numerous peers can join and leave freely in short periods of
  time.

  % Globally, Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} also demonstrates that the logarithmic
  % growth of these sampling protocols constitutes an upper bound, for
  % smaller growth could be obtained without endangering the connectedness of
  % the
  % network.
\item[Reasons:] The random peer-sampling approaches \CYCLON and \SPRAY yield
  very similar results because the number of neighbors provided by both
  approaches is very close when the network reaches 10k.  Yet \CYCLON performs
  slightly better for two reasons. First the variance in the degree distribution
  of \SPRAY causes \CYCLON to have more arcs in this specific
  experiment. Second, \SPRAY wastes some of its neighbors due to the presence of
  duplicate entries in its views (yet the number of duplicates remains small --
  see Figure~\ref{fig:duplicates}). Still both protocols preserve the ability to
  disseminate information until very large removal percentages. Another way to
  interpret this result consists in observing that when all peers have similar
  degrees, (see Figure~\ref{fig:histo}), removing a particular peer does not
  greatly affect connectedness. As suggested above, the direction of arcs
  impacts more information dissemination than the peer-sampling protocol
  itself. If an arc constitutes the last link between two clusters of the
  network, the messages from one of these clusters cannot reach the other
  one. Yet, this arc is enough for the peer-sampling protocol to start shuffling
  the views, ultimately populating them with members from both cluster. Hence,
  the network repairs itself.  When clusters become fully disjoints, neither
  \CYCLON nor \SPRAY is able to repair the network.

  % A smaller growth could be obtained because the sharp threshold of
  % connectedness applies to random graphs according to Erd{\H
  % o}s-R{\' e}nyi~\cite{erdos1959random}. However, random peer sampling
  % protocols constraint the partial views size to reduce the variance between
  % peers.  With such slight difference, we presume that a lower bound on arcs
  % growth could be found, although that may require global knowledge.
\end{asparadesc}

\subsection{Duplicates}

\begin{asparadesc} 
\item[Objective:] To show that a small proportion of peers contains duplicates
  in their partial view.
\item[Description:] Using \SPRAY as random peer-sampling protocol, we measure
  the amount of peers which have a partial view containing at least one
  duplicated reference. We perform the measurements on networks containing 0.1k,
  1k, 10k, 100k, and 500k peers. We measure the number of duplicates after
  convergence. We put this in relation with a theoretical approximation from the
  birthday paradox where the view size would be the number of randomly chosen
  people and the identity of peers would be the birthdates. The probability of a
  peer to \emph{not} have duplicates is approximately:
  \begin{equation*} 
    -\exp({-\ln(|V^t|)*(\ln(|V^t|)-1)\over{2*|V^t|}})
  \end{equation*}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\SCALE\columnwidth]{img/duplicates.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:duplicates}Duplicates in networks of different size.}
\end{figure}


\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:duplicates} shows the proportion of peers using
  a partial view containing duplicates. We observe that there always exist
  partial views with at least one duplicate. The proportion is more important
  when the network size is small (e.g. 5 percents for 0.1k peers). It becomes a
  minor overhead when the network size is larger (e.g. less than 1 percent for
  10k peers). The birthday paradox approximation seems to follow very closely
  the experimental results. It empirically indicates that there exists a
  relation between the duplicates and the birthday paradox. The proportion of
  peers without duplicates tends to 100 percents as the network size grows.
\item[Reasons:] While the number of peers in the network grows linearly, the
  neighborhood size of each peer only grows logarithmically. This significant
  difference between the growths leads to the fact that the chances of a
  particular peer to have at least twice the reference to another peer becomes
  smaller as the number of peers in the network increases.
\end{asparadesc}


\subsection{Failures in connection establishment}
\label{subsec:degeneration}


\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To show that \SPRAY does not suffer from failures in
  connection establishments, contrarily to \SCAMP.
\item[Description:] We measure both the arc count and the number of weak
  components in the network. The simulations involve \CYCLON configured with
  partial views containing 9 neighbors, \SCAMP\footnote{A modified version of
    \SCAMP whose periodic protocol works properly when there is no connection
    failures. Available at \url{https://github.com/justayak/peersim-spray}}, and
  \SPRAY. They run over 50k cycles. The network initially contains 10k members.
  To establish a connection, we use the WebRTC three-way handshake, i.e., the
  initial peer emits an offer ticket, the arrival peer stamps the ticket, the
  initial peer finalizes the connection using the stamped ticket (see
  Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork}). The probability that the ticket fails to
  traverse a hop is set to $10^{-3}$.

\item[Results:] The top part of Figure~\ref{fig:degeneration} shows the arc
  count of the random peer-sampling protocols while the bottom part of
  Figure~\ref{fig:degeneration} shows the weak components of the network.  As
  expected, we observe that the arc counts of \CYCLON and \SPRAY stays constant
  over cycles: 90k and 93k arcs for \CYCLON and \SPRAY respectively. On the
  other hand, \SCAMP suffers from failures in connection establishment. This
  directly impacts network connectedness as measured by the weak-component
  ratio. The network of \SCAMP quickly degrades.

  These results show that both \SPRAY and \CYCLON fit the constraints set by the
  connection establishement protocol of WebRTC.

\item[Reasons:] The arc counts of \CYCLON and \SPRAY remains constant
  over time but for different reasons. In \CYCLON, the shuffling
  protocol makes sure that the partial view is filled to its
  maximum. When a peer removes a broken connection, it replaces it
  with a fresh one in the following round.  In \SPRAY, when the
  protocol tries to use a broken connection, it replaces it with
  another known one. Thus, the arc count stays constant and the
  shuffling protocol makes sure that duplicates disappear over time
  (the arc moves to another peer where it is not a duplicate).
  \SCAMP, however, does not establish new connections with the
  neighbors of its neighbors.  Each hop of connection establishment
  process is an opportunity for failure.  Let $P_f$ be the probability
  that an element of the dissemination path (either a peer or a
  connection) crashes or leaves during a hop of the three-way
  handshake, without any possible recovery. Let $P_E$ be the
  probability that a connection establishment cannot be
  completed. Without three-way handshake, $P_E$ is straightforward:
  \begin{equation} P_{E,\,1way}^{Scamp}=1-(1-
    P_f)^{k+1} \end{equation} This corresponds to the probability that
  each element (arc and peer) in the path of size $k+1$ stays alive
  during the random walk. In the context of WebRTC, the offer ticket
  must travel back to its emitter. As a consequence, the elements of
  the random walk cannot fail until the stamped ticket travels
  back. We obtain:
  \begin{align} P_{E,\,3way}^{Scamp} &=1 - ((1-P_f)^{2(k+1)} (1-P_f)^{2k}
                                       \ldots (1-P_f)^2) \nonumber \\
                                     &=1-(1-P_f)^{k^2+3k+2}
  \end{align}
  In other terms, the first chosen arc and peer in the path must stay
  alive $2k+2$ hops, the second chosen arc and peer must stay alive
  $2k$ hops and so on.  This long duration leads to a quicker
  degeneration of the connection count.

  % This behavior endangers the network
  % connectedness.%%, as depicted in Section~\ref{subsec:degeneration}.

  % Since there is no routing in such network, the only way for a stamped ticket
  % to come back to its emitter is the path it traveled in the first place. Hence,
  % all peers belonging to the path must stay alive until the stamped ticket comes
  % back in order to consistently forward it.  Furthermore, its periodic protocol
  % starts with an immediate cutting of the incoming arcs of the initiating peer
  % because it assumes that each connection spread in the network will establish.
  % Since it does not, the peer eventually becomes disconnected. Also, when its
  % neighbors execute the periodic protocol, they delete their reference in its
  % partial view. In such case, the peer becomes disconnected and partitions
  % quickly appear.
