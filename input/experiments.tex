\section{Experimentation}
\label{sec:experiments}

In this section, we evaluate how adaptiveness of \SPRAY impacts common metrics
of peer sampling performance including clustering coefficient, average shortest
path length, in-degree distribution, arc count, and connected components. We use
\CYCLON as a baseline with a fixed-size view for experiments relative to
adaptiveness. We expect similar behaviors when the network size is optimal for
\CYCLON. We expect \SPRAY to save resources when \CYCLON is oversized. Also,
\SPRAY should be more robust when \CYCLON is undersized. Finally, we expect
\SPRAY to keep a negligible number of duplicates in its partial views. The
experiments run on the \PEERSIM simulator~\cite{montresor2009peersim}. The code
of the random peer sampling protocols is available on the Github
platform\footnote{\url{https://github.com/justayak/peersim-spray}}.



In a second time, we highlight the improvements brought to gossiping protocols
on a real-life use case concerning decentralized collaborative editing in
browsers.  These experiments run on Grid'5000 testbed and involve uptill 600
browsers simultaneously writing a document. We expect a traffic logarithmically
scaling compared to the network size, along with a polylogarithmic growth
brought by the application itself. The real-time editor called \CRATE is hosted
on the Github platform\footnote{\url{http://chat-wane.github.io/CRATE/}}.

% connection failures. Unlike \SCAMP, we expect \SPRAY to
% tolerate connection failures.

\subsection{Spray's properties}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To observe how adaptiveness impacts on \textbf{clustering} and
  \textbf{convergence time}.
\item[Description:] The average clustering coefficient $\overline{C}$ measures
  the connectivity of each peer's neighborhood in the network.
  \begin{equation}
    \overline{C} = {1\over |\mathcal{N}|}\sum\limits_{x\in\mathcal{N}}C_x
  \end{equation}
  where $C_x$ is the local clustering coefficient of Peer $p_x$.  The
  runs concern 0.1k, 1k, 10k and 100k peers. The representative of
  fixed-size approach is \CYCLON which is optimally configured for 1k
  peers: its partial views are set to $\ln(1000)\approx 7$
  neighbors. During gossip exchanges, the peers using \CYCLON shuffle
  $3$ out of their $7$ neighbors. Thus, \CYCLON is oversized for 0.1k
  peers and undersized for 10k peers and 100k peers.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:clustering} shows that \CYCLON starts
  with a lower clustering coefficients than \SPRAY. Still, \SPRAY
  converges faster than \CYCLON. Furthermore, when the number of peers
  in the network grows, the convergence time of \CYCLON suffers
  heavily. On the contrary, \SPRAY converges very quickly
  independently of the network size. Figure~\ref{fig:clustering} also
  shows that both approaches converge to a low clustering coefficient
  which is characteristic of random graphs. Nevertheless, \CYCLON and
  \SPRAY do not reach the same values after convergence. Except when
  \CYCLON is optimally configured, \SPRAY's values are either below
  (when \CYCLON is oversized) or above (when \CYCLON is undersized).
  Overall, this shows that \SPRAY is
  \begin{inparaenum}
  \item faster to converge to a stable clustering coefficient
  \item reflecting the needs of the network membership.
  \end{inparaenum}
  This impacts both load-balancing and robustness to churn (when peers
  join and leave the network freely).
\item[Reasons:] \CYCLON starts with a lower clustering coefficient
  because each peer performs random walks to advertise themselves in
  the network. Hence, the starting overlay is already slightly
  balanced when the simulation starts the shufflings. On the other
  hand, a newcomer peer in \SPRAY only advertises itself to the
  neighborhood of its contact peer. Therefore, the network overlay
  starts strongly unbalanced, independently of the network
  size. Still, \CYCLON converges more slowly than \SPRAY because of
  its fixed-size partial view and the size of the shuffle. When they
  are \emph{a priori} configured, they constitute a constraint to the
  convergence speed.  The clustering coefficient measures how much the
  neighborhood of each peer is connected to the rest of the
  network. It directly depends of the partial view size of each peer
  which, in \CYCLON, is fixed. Thus, when the peers number is
  multiplied by $10$, the clustering coefficient after convergence is
  divided by $10$. On the other hand, the peers using \SPRAY have
  variable-size partial views that carefully reflect the network size
  with a logarithmic growth. Thus, when the network has 1k peers, the
  partial view size adapts to this network size. This explains the
  slightly lower clustering coefficient of \SPRAY on this run (\SPRAY
  7.4 vs \CYCLON 7). By extending the reasoning, this also explains
  why \SPRAY yields lower values when \CYCLON is oversized, and why it
  yields higher values when \CYCLON is undersized.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{img/avgpath.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:avgpath}Average shortest path length.}
\end{figure}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To observe how adaptiveness impacts on the average shortest
  path length, i.e., on the \textbf{efficiency of information dissemination}.
\item[Description:] The average path length is the average of the shortest path
  length between peers in the graph. It counts the minimum number of hops to
  reach a peer from another given peer. It basically represents the traveling
  time of any information to reach all the peers at least once. We average the
  path length on a small subset of the network membership and run $100$ times
  the simulation on \SPRAY to avoid any side effects due to randomness. We also
  run the simulation on different configurations of \CYCLON targeting different
  optimal network size. \CYCLON set with the partial view size of 7 roughly
  targets 1.1k peers. \CYCLON set with the partial view size of 9 roughly
  targets 8.1k peers. \CYCLON set with the partial view size of 11 roughly
  targets 60k peers. In all these simulations, we perform the measurements
  after convergence. The checkpoints for the measurements are 0.1k, 0.5k, 1k,
  5k, 10k, 50k, and 100k peers.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:avgpath} shows that both \CYCLON and \SPRAY
  have an average shortest path length relatively small. Thus, the information
  can disseminate to all the network very quickly. Figure~\ref{fig:avgpath}
  also shows that, each run of \CYCLON taken alone can be divided in three
  parts compared to \SPRAY. First, an oversized \CYCLON disseminates the
  information faster than \SPRAY. Then, \SPRAY and \CYCLON are equivalent
  where the latter is optimally configured. Finally, \SPRAY yields better
  results. Yet, overall, \SPRAY scales better than \CYCLON since the
  gradient of the former is lower than any configuration of the latter one.
\item[Reasons:] We perform all the measurements after convergence where the
  network overlay is closely related to random graphs. In such graph, the
  diameter and average shortest path length stay relatively small, as the
  resulting values shown in Figure~\ref{fig:avgpath}. The second observation
  concerns each \CYCLON configuration compared alone with \SPRAY. While an
  oversized \CYCLON is much better connected into the graph and thus yields a
  lower average path length than \SPRAY, as soon as it is undersized, \SPRAY
  is, thanks to larger partial views, better connected into the graph.
  Consequently, it yields the shorter average path length. \SPRAY scales better
  than any configuration of \CYCLON because it always follows the optimal
  value.

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To observe how adaptiveness impacts the in-degree
  distribution, i.e., the \textbf{load-balancing} among peers.
\item[Description:] The in-degree of a peer shows how well this peer is
  represented in others' partial view. The in-degree distribution of the
  network can highlight the existence of weakly connected peers and strongly
  connected hubs. It has a direct impact on robustness. In this experiment, the
  fixed-size partial view approach is \CYCLON{}. It is configured with partial
  views of size $7$ which is optimal for a network of roughly $1100$ peers.
  For all the experiments, we perform the in-degree measurements after
  convergence. The measurements concern networks with 0.1k, 1k, 100k, 500k
  peers.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:histo} shows the in-degree distribution of
  \CYCLON and \SPRAY. In the top figure, we observe that the distribution and
  the degrees of \CYCLON are identical, independently of the network
  size. Thus, the distribution of 0.1k peers is identical to the 500k one with
  a mean value of roughly 7 with a strong peak on this value. On the other
  hand, the bottom figure shows that the distribution of \SPRAY follows average
  partial view size which follows the network size
  growth. Figure~\ref{fig:histo} also shows that peers are very gathered around
  the mean partial view size. For instance, for the run with 500k peers using
  \SPRAY, the mean value for the in-degree is 13.37 and 88 percents of the
  peers have an in-degree comprised between 12 and 14 included. It means that
  the load is well balanced among peers. Since peers are equally important in
  term of connectedness, the network is robust to failures.
\item[Reasons:] Once configured, \CYCLON must handle any number of peers in the
  network with a fixed-size partial view. Proportionally, the number of times
  that a particular peer is referenced does not change compared to the network
  size. Indeed, the number of arcs that a new peer brings to the network when it
  joins constitutes that many arcs targeting it after the shuffling
  rounds. Since the partial view size is constant, the in-degree of peers stays
  stable. On the other hand, in \SPRAY, each joining peer brings a increasing
  number of arcs in the network. Thus, the in-degree of each peer grows
  reflecting the network size. Hence, the distribution in the bottom figure
  shifts slowly to higher in-degree values as the network size grows.  \SPRAY
  does not peak on a particular value as \CYCLON because the average partial
  view size for a particular network size falls in-between integer values. For
  instance, if the average partial view size is 6.5, then half of them will
  have a size of 6 while the other half will have a size of 7. Such network is
  robust to failure because no peer is more important than other in term of
  connectedness. Therefore, if some random peer crashes, it will not affect
  the network as much as if a strongly connected peer crashed.
\end{asparadesc}

\ \\

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To show the impact of adaptiveness when the network size
  changes over time.
\item[Description:] In this experiment we focus on a dynamic network where
  peers can join and leave. The runs involve \CYCLON and \SPRAY. \CYCLON's
  configuration targets roughly 8.1k peers. Thus, it is oversized compared the
  network size during the simulation (maximum 1k peers). During the first half
  of the experimentation, 250 peers are added 4 times successively by intervals
  of 10 cycles each. Thus, the network size goes from 0 to 1k peers in 40
  rounds. Then, half of the network leaves without giving notice (500
  peers). Finally, 250 peers join two additional times. The final network
  contains 1k members. The measurements concern
  \begin{inparaenum}
  \item the number of connections in the network over cycles,
  \item the variance of the partial view sizes over cycles
    (cf. Section~\ref{subsec:cyclic}),
  \item the average partial view size of peers.
  \end{inparaenum}
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:churn} shows the result of the experiment. The
  x-axis represents the cycles (i.e. the arbitrary unit time frame). The top
  part of Figure~\ref{fig:churnA} shows the number of connections established
  in the network (scale $\times 10^3$) while its bottom part shows the variance
  in the partial view size of the members. Concerning \SPRAY, we can see that
  at each batch of joining, the connection number grows to reflect the needs
  of the new network membership. The observation is consistent with the
  variance measures. Indeed, at each batch of insertions, the variance suddenly
  grows. Then, it exponentially decreases and converges to zero in less than 10
  cycles. The variance is higher when the network size is lower. For instance,
  the first 250 peers lead to the highest variance. At the $40^{th}$ cycle,
  half of the peers leave/crash. Approximately half of the connections are directly
  removed without disturbing the variance of partial views. The 10 following
  cycles show a slight decrease of arcs. Then new members are introduced in the
  network yielding the same results as the earlier joins. \CYCLON exposes an
  identical behavior. Nevertheless, the number of arcs is invariably higher
  than the \SPRAY one (from 1000 to 2500 additional
  connections). Figure~\ref{fig:churnB} shows the average partial view size of
  \SPRAY and \CYCLON. As expected, \CYCLON immediately converges to the
  configured partial view size (9 neighbors). On the other hand, \SPRAY's
  partial views logarithmically grow while the network grows. When the removals
  occur at cycle 40, the peers using \CYCLON remove the dead arcs while
  refilling their partial view until they reach the configured partial view
  size. \SPRAY only remove the arcs to reflect the departed peers. At the end,
  the \SPRAY partial views contain in average 6.6 neighbors (recall,
  $\ln(1000)\approx 6.9$).
\item[Reasons:] Since the partial views of \SPRAY adapt themselves to the
  network size, the number of connections grows as the network membership
  grows.  The peaks in variance correspond to the joining parts of the
  experiment. The disparity comes from the fact that new peers arrive in the
  network with a small partial view. The peaks are smaller when the network is
  larger. Indeed, the peers - which were already network members before the new
  arrivals - had a few cycles to exchanges and even out their partial views. As
  consequence, it lessens the weight of joinings. The removal of 500 peers does
  not disturb the variance since each crashing/leaving peer is chosen at
  random. Thus, no peers suffer more of these removals than others. The
  slightly decreasing number of arcs after the removal is due to peers
  realizing that some arcs are dead, leading to a probabilistic removal
  (cf. Algorithm~\ref{algo:unreachable}).

  \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{img/resilience.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:resilience}Robustness to massive failures.}
\end{figure}

\ \\

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] To show that both \SPRAY and \CYCLON are equally
  \textbf{robust to massive failures}.
\item[Description:] Counting the strong components in a network allows
  estimating the area that are reachable by the information dissemination
  protocols. For instance, there are 2 strong components if a part of the
  network can reach another part and the converse being false.  Counting the
  weak components in a network allows estimating the point where the network is
  still in a repairable state, i.e., after some shufflings, the network will
  converge to an overlay where the information dissemination is able to reach
  all members again. \CYCLON has a partial view size set to 9. The network
  contains 10k members. We perform the removals after the approaches converged
  to a stable overlay network. We remove the batch of peers at once, from 25 to
  95 percents of peers every 5 percents, i.e., 16 runs for each approach. We
  perform a last measurement at 99 percents. We perform the measurements
  immediately after the removals. The removals concern a percentage of the
  peers chosen at random among the 10k members.
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} shows the ratio of strong/weak
  components over the network size after removals. First, the figure shows
  that both the random peer sampling protocols, \SPRAY and \CYCLON, suffer from
  deteriorated behavior at high removal percentages, \CYCLON being slightly
  better in this term. Figure~\ref{fig:resilience} shows that the information
  dissemination (strong components) starts to slowly degrade at 45 percents,
  and quickly degrade at 70 percents. Fortunately, Figure~\ref{fig:resilience}
  also shows that the approaches are able to recover from such clustering until
  high removal rate. Indeed, the weak components start to increase at 70
  percents, meaning that some part of the network are completely disjoint and
  beyond repair.
\item[Reasons:] The random peer sampling approaches \CYCLON and \SPRAY expose
  very similar results because \CYCLON's configuration targets a network size
  of 10k peers, while \SPRAY adjusts itself automatically to this network size.
  Therefore, the arc number in the approaches are close from being identical
  \CYCLON is slightly better because, in this case, it has more arcs (due to
  \SPRAY's randomness) and because it does not have duplicates (\SPRAY contains
  a small amount of duplicates in the partial view,
  cf. Section~\ref{subsec:duplicates}). It requires a high amount of removals
  to endanger the information dissemination protocol's ability to reach all
  peers. Indeed, since all peers are equally important in the network
  (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:histo}), removing a particular peer does not greatly
  affect the whole network. The network membership protocol is able to repair
  the topology later than the information dissemination starts to fail because
  the direction of arcs is not as important as in the latter. Indeed, \CYCLON
  and \SPRAY are still able to repair a network until parts of the network
  become disjoint, i.e., there is no arc between these parts of the network.

\end{figure}

\ \\

\begin{asparadesc} 
\item[Objective:] To show that a small proportion of peers contain
  \textbf{duplicates} in their partial view.
\item[Description:] Using \SCAMP as random peer sampling protocol, we measure
  the amount of peers which have a partial view containing at least one
  duplicated reference. We perform the measurements on networks containing
  0.1k, 1k, 10k, 100k, and 500k peers. We measure the number of duplicates
  after convergence. We put this in relation with a theoretical approximation
  from the birthday paradox. The probability of a peer to not have duplicates
  is approximately:
  \begin{equation}
    1- 
    (1-
    \exp({-\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)*(\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)-1)\over{2*|\mathcal{N}|}}))
  \end{equation}
\item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:duplicates} shows the proportion of peers using
  a partial view containing duplicates. As we can observe, there always exist
  partial views with at least one duplicate. The proportion is more important
  when the network size is small (e.g. 5 percents for 0.1k peers), and it
  becomes a minor overhead when the network size is larger (e.g. less than 1
  percent for 10k peers). The birthday paradox approximation seems to follow
  very closely the experimental results. It empirically confirms that there
  exist a relation between the duplicates and the birthday paradox. The
  proportion of peers without duplicates tends to 100 percents as the network
  size grows.
\item[Reasons:] As the network grows, the chances of a particular peer to have
  at least twice the reference to another peer becomes smaller. Indeed, while
  the network grows linearly, the number of references to a particular peer
  only grows logarithmically. Nevertheless, the birthday paradox reminds that
  this proportion is not as small as it seems to be.

% \begin{asparadesc}
% \item[Objective:] To show that \SPRAY does not suffer from \textbf{failures} in
%   connection establishments, contrarily to \SCAMP.
% \item[Description:] We measure both the arc count and the number of weak
%   components in the network. The simulations involve \CYCLON (configured with
%   partial view containing 9 neighbors targeting a network of roughly 8100
%   peers), \SCAMP\footnote{A modified version of \SCAMP whose periodic protocol
%     works properly when there is no connection failures. Available at
%     \url{https://github.com/justayak/peersim-spray}}, and \SPRAY. They run over
%   50k cycles. The network initially contains 10k members.  To establish a
%   connection, we use the WebRTC three-way handshake, i.e., the initial peer
%   emits an offer ticket, the arrival peer stamps the ticket, the initial peer
%   finalizes the connection using the stamped ticket
%   (cf. Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork}). The probability that the ticket fails to
%   arrive to its destination is set to $10^{-3}$ for each hop.
% \item[Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:degeneration} has two parts. The
%   top figure shows the arc count of the random peer samplings while the bottom
%   figure shows the weak components of the network.  First, we observe that, as
%   expected, the arc count of \CYCLON and \SPRAY stays constant over cycles: 90k
%   and 93k arcs for \CYCLON and \SPRAY respectively. Second, we observe that
%   \SCAMP suffers from the failures on connection establishments. It directly
%   impacts on the connectedness of the network represented by the weak
%   components ratio. The network of \SCAMP quickly degrades.
% \item[Reasons:] The arc count of both \CYCLON and \SPRAY remains constant over
%   time but for different reasons. In \CYCLON, the shuffling protocol makes sure
%   that the partial view is filled to its maximum. Thus, when it uses a not
%   successfully established connection to perform an exchange, it simply
%   discards the connection, knowing that the next exchange is likely to overfill
%   its partial view. In \SPRAY, when a connection fails to establish and the
%   protocol tries to use it for an exchange, it will replace this arc with
%   another known reference. Thus, the arc count stays constant and the shuffling
%   protocol makes sure that duplicates disappear over time (the arc moves to
%   another peer where it is not a duplicate). In \SCAMP, the connections are
%   much more likely to fail than in the aforementioned protocols. Indeed,
%   contrarily to these latter, \SCAMP does not cautiously establish connections
%   with the neighbors of its neighbors.  Each hop of its ticket dissemination is
%   an opportunity of failure. Since there is no routing in such network, the
%   only way for a stamped ticket to come back to its emitter is the path it
%   traveled in the first place. Hence, all peers belonging to the path must stay
%   alive until the stamped ticket comes back in order to consistently forward
%   it.  Furthermore, its periodic protocol starts with an immediate cutting of
%   the incoming arcs of the initiating peer because it assumes that each
%   connection spread in the network will establish.  Since it does not, the peer
%   eventually becomes disconnected. Also, when its neighbors execute the
%   periodic protocol, they delete their reference in its partial view. In such
%   case, the peer becomes disconnected and partitions quickly appear.

\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Objective:] To show the evolution of the average neighborhood size of
  members of an editing session. The \SPRAY protocol aims to provide a
  logarithmically scaling neighborhood compared to the global network
  size. Furthermore, the protocol builds a dynamic network where the load is
  balanced among members.
\item [Description:] During a run, peers dynamically modify their
  neighborhood. Each peer periodically reports its neighborhood size. Then, we
  average all these values and measure the variance. The average value defines
  how connected is a member to the network, impacting (among other) on the
  information dissemination efficiency. The variance defines how spread are the
  values; a small value means a good load balancing among members. Runs comprise
  from 101 members to 601 members with 100 members increments, i.e., 6 different
  runs.  The first member creates the editing session which is progressively
  joined by the other writers (1 joiner per 5 seconds). Each member starts
  sharing the document as soon as its joining. Hence, outsiders can join the
  network through one of them chosen at random.
\item [Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:partialview} shows the results of this
  experiment. The figure displays the network size on the x-axis and the average
  neighborhood size on the y-axis. It shows the average value of each experiment
  along with the theoretical expectation: a natural logarithm on the global
  network size. Each average value also carries the variance measurement. As
  expected, we observe that the average neighborhood size grows logarithmically
  compared to the size of the network despite being scattered around the
  theoretical curve. Figure~\ref{fig:partialview} also shows that the variance
  is small around the average values. Thus, members have an even neighborhood
  size. In other terms, the load is well-balanced among members when they need
  to disseminate information to the whole network. At the opposite of
  centralized solutions, it builds a topology where no member is more important
  than another in term of connectivity. As such, the network is more resilient
  to random crashes or unexpected departures.
\item [Reasons:] When an outsider wants to join the editing session, it picks a
  random sharer as first contact. \SPRAY assumes that the neighborhood size of
  this particular member is already logarithmic compared to the network
  size. Therefore, it uses this assumption to create additional connections that
  increase logarithmically in number. Yet, the averages neighborhood size does
  not follow exactly the theoretical expectation curve. Indeed, the number of
  neighbors of each member strongly depends of the first contact. However, the
  specific average value is not necessarily reached, especially considering
  that, while the theoretical expectation is a floating number, the neighborhood
  size belongs to the integers. This fact also impacts the variance. Indeed, the
  \SPRAY protocol exchanges the neighborhood of member over time. During the
  exchanges, it aims to balance the neighborhood size of each peer. Yet, the
  average value may not be an integer value. Therefore, the neighborhood size of
  the members constantly fluctuates around the average value.

\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Objective:] To show that both the identifier size and neighborhood size
  impact the traffic. Since the former grows polylogarithmically, and the latter
  grows logarithmically, we expect the traffic to scale in terms of number of
  users and number of operations.
\item [Description:] As for prior experiments, this experimentation concerns
  networks from 101 members to 601 members, each coauthoring a document of over
  a million of characters by repeatedly inserting new characters at the end of
  the document. Figure~\ref{fig:partialview} displays the average neighborhood
  size of members of each run. Figure~\ref{fig:identifiers} displays the
  identifiers size of each run. This experiment measure average traffic of
  members in Megabyte per second. For the recall, 100 operations are performed
  per second uniformly distributed among participants.
\item [Results:] Figure~\ref{fig:traffic} shows the result of this experiment.
  The x-axis denotes the experiment progression. The y-axis shows the average
  outgoing traffic generated by members (in Megabyte per second). As expected,
  we observe three results:
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item It confirms the results of both prior experiments about the neighborhood
    size (i.e., a logarithmically growing/shrinking neighborhood size compared
    to the network size), and the size of identifiers (i.e. a
    polylogarithmic growth compared to the size of the document).
  \item Being adaptive, the \SPRAY membership protocol grants the ability to
    disseminate information scaling with the network dimension.
  \item The growth of identifiers constitutes an important part of the traffic

  Hence, \CRATE scales in terms of number of users and number of operations.
\item [Reasons:] When an outsider joins the network, it injects a number of
  connections roughly logarithmic compared to the current network size. When it
  generates an operation, it sends its result to its neighborhood. Since this
  result (i.e. the identifier) grows polylogarithmically compared to the
  document size, and since the neighborhood grows logarithmically compared to
  the network size, it multiplies the polylogarithm with the logarithm. When a
  member receives such operation, and it receives it for the first time, it
  sends it to its neighborhood. Therefore, for each operation performed by any
  member, the rest of the members will send the result of the operation to all
  their respective neighborhood once. As such, the network load is balanced
  among users. Furthermore, it scales in number of editing session members and
  document size.
