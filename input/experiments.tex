\label{sec:experiments}
In this section we examine the properties of \SCAMPLON{} and 
compare them to state-of-the-art random peer sampling protocols, \SCAMP{} and \CYCLON{}. 
The experiments\footnote{Implementation: http://github.com/anonymous4now}
involved up to 100,000 nodes and were carried out on \PEERSIM{} \cite{peersim}, 
a simulator for peer-to-peer networks.
As peers periodically exchange information we define a cycle to be 
the $\Delta t$ time period in which each peer executes the shuffle protocol once.

We inspect three properties characteristic of random graphs, namely the
\emph{average shortest path length}, the \emph{average clustering coefficient},
and \emph{the partial view size distribution}. Additionally, we investigate on
\emph{robustness to random failures}.

\subsection{Clustering coefficient}
\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:]
\item[Description:] The average clustering coefficient measures the
  connectivity of each peer's neighborhood in the network.
  \begin{equation}
    \overline{C} = {1\over |\mathcal{N}|}\sum\limits_{x\in\mathcal{N}}C_x
    \end{equation}
    where $C_x$ is the local clustering coefficient of Peer $p_x$. The higher
    the coefficient, the more likely the network contains cliques. These
    experiments involve 100, 1000, and 10000 peers. \CYCLON{} is set to be optimal
    at 1000 peers with $|\mathcal{P}|$ set to $7$. The exchanges concern $3$
    neighbors.

\subsection{Average path length}
\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:]
\item[Description:] The average path length is the average of the shortest path
  length between peers in the graph. It counts the minimum number of hops to
  reach a peer from another given peer. The lower the value, the faster a
  message can reach the whole network.
