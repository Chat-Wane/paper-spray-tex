\section{Experimentation}
\label{sec:experiments}
In this section we examine the properties of \SCAMPLON{} and 
compare them to state-of-the-art random peer sampling protocols, \SCAMP{} and \CYCLON{}. 
The experiments\footnote{Implementation: https://github.com/anonymous/anonymous4now}
involve up to 100,000 nodes and are carried out on \PEERSIM{} \cite{peersim}, 
a simulator for peer-to-peer networks.
We define a cycle as $\Delta t$ in which each peer has executed its active protocol once.

We inspect three properties characteristic for random graphs, 
the \emph{average shortest path length}, the \emph{average clustering coefficient},
and \emph{the partial view size distribution}. Additionally, we investigate on
\emph{robustness to random failures}.

\subsection{Clustering coefficient}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:]
    %% Highlight  
    We want to evaluate to what degree \SCAMPLON{} generates clusters in the overlay.
    To satisfy the random peer sampling objective it is desired that the network has very few clusters,
    thus has a low clustering coefficient.
\item[Description:] 
    The average clustering coefficient $\overline{C}$  measures the connectivity of each peer's neighborhood in the network.
  \begin{equation}
    \overline{C} = {1\over |\mathcal{N}|}\sum\limits_{x\in\mathcal{N}}C_x
    \end{equation}
    where $C_x$ is the local clustering coefficient of Peer $p_x$. The higher
    the coefficient, the more likely the network contains cliques. These
    experiments involve 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000 peers. \CYCLON{} is set to be optimal
    at 1000 peers with $|\mathcal{P}|$ set to $7$ while using $3$ peers for exchange.

\subsection{Average path length}

    \caption{Average shortest path}
    \label{fig:avgpath}
\end{figure}

\begin{asparadesc}
\item[Objective:] 
    For messages to disseminate quickly into the network it is crucial 
    that the shortest path to other peers is, in fact, short.
\item[Description:] The average path length is the average of the shortest path
  length between peers in the graph. It counts the minimum number of hops to
  reach a peer from another given peer.
  For performance reasons, we selected a subset of 7 nodes, calculated their
  average shortest path and averaged it.
\item[Results:]
When undersized, \CYCLON{} yield a shorter average shortest path then \SCAMPLON{}~\ref{fig:clustering}.
