\section{Introduction}

Peer sampling service is a fundamental mechanism for many large-scale
distributed applications including information dissemination, aggregation and
network management~\cite{jelasity2007gossip}. Recently,
WebRTC\footnote{\url{http://www.webrtc.org/}} opened the opportunity to deploy
large scale distributed applications on brow\-sers that can run on laptops,
desktops and mobile devices. Among others, WebRTC drastically simplifies
the deployment of large-scale distributed applications even within complex
network systems that utilize firewalls, proxies and Net Address Translation
(NAT).

Unfortunately, WebRTC has several constraints that make existing peer
sampling services inefficient or unreliable. Brow\-sers can run
on small devices in mobile networks. Hence, keeping the number of
connections as low as possible is a major requirement. However, peer
sampling services such as \CYCLON~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon} do not
adapt the number of connections to the real number of
participants. For instance, a user must maintain 10 connections with
other remote browsers when only 6 are enough. On the other hand, the
peer sampling service \SCAMP~\cite{ganesh2003peer} is adaptive but
uses random walks to establish connections which is much more
costly and likely to fail in the WebRTC context.

In this paper, we introduce \SPRAY, a random peer sampling protocol inspired
by both \CYCLON~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon} and
\SCAMP~\cite{ganesh2003peer}. Compared to the state of art,
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item \SPRAY dynamically adapts the neighborhood of each peer. Thus, the number
  of connections grows logarithmically compared to the size of the network.
\item \SPRAY only uses neighbor-to-neighbor interactions to establish
  connections. Thus, the connections are established in constant time.
\item \SPRAY converges exponentially fast to a topology exposing properties
  similar to random graphs. Thus, the network becomes quickly resilient to
  massive failures, efficiently disseminates information etc.
\item In the experimental setup, we show the adaptiveness of \SPRAY and
  highlight its efficiency improvement compared to \CYCLON, at the cost of
  little overhead.
\end{inparaenum}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork}
reviews the related work. Section~\ref{sec:proposal} details the \SPRAY
protocol. Section~\ref{sec:experiments} shows the properties of \SPRAY
and compares them to state-of-the-art random peer sampling approaches. We
conclude and discuss about the perspective in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
