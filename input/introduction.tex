\section{Introduction}

Recently, WebRTC~\cite{webrtc} allowed the connection establishment between web
browsers, even with complex network settings such as firewall, proxies or Net
Address Translation (NAT).  Some attractive applications such as Firefox
Hello~\cite{firefoxhello} or WebTorrent~\cite{webtorrent} demonstrate how
video-conferencing or file-sharing directly within browsers becomes simple of
access to end-users without third-party providers. However, several distributed
applications such as distributed collaborative editors (REFs) require the
ability to broadcast messages to a potentially large number of
participants. Traditionally, gossiping algorithms~\cite{eugster2003lightweight,
  tolgyeski2009adaptive} achieve such broadcast in a scalable way by using a
sample of the whole network. Unfortunately, the sampling
protocols~\cite{eugster2003lightweight, tolgyeski2009adaptive, ganesh2003peer,
  jelasity2004peer, voulgaris2005cyclon} raises efficiency and robustness
issues in the WebRTC context.

Scalable gossiping requires that each member maintains connections with a
uniform sample of the other members. The sample, called partial view, can grow
logarithmically compared to the number of participants and yet providing
connectivity with high probability~\cite{erdos1959random}. Still, the
neighborhood must be constantly renewed in order to prevent network partitions
due to churn (i.e. members join and leave freely). In WebRTC, establishing a
browser-to-browser connection requires a three-way handshake which is much more
costly and likely to fail compared to traditional setting. In such context,
state-of-the-art random peer sampling protocols either lack of robustness or
have resource intensive requirements.

Knowingly, the challenge is about
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item keeping an optimal $\Theta(\ln |\mathcal{N}|)$ on the number of
  connections alive\cite{erdos1959random} (where $\mathcal{N}$ is the set of
  network members),
\item keeping an optimal $O(1)$ complexity on connection establishments,
\item keeping an optimal $\Theta(\exp \, t^{-1})$ convergence speed to a random
  graph (where $t$ is an arbitrary time frame).
\end{inparaenum}

In this paper, we introduce \SCAMPLON{}, a random peer sampling protocol
inspired by both \SCAMP{}~\cite{ganesh2003peer} and
\CYCLON{}~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon}. It provides the desired properties
described in the aforementioned problem statement.
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item It dynamically adapts the neighborhood of each peer. Thus, the number of
  connections grows logarithmically compared to the size of the network.
\item It only uses neighbor-to-neighbor interactions to establish the
  connections. Thus, the connections are established in constant time.
\item It converges exponentially fast to a random graph. Thus, the network
  becomes quickly resilient to failure, can broadcast messages efficiently etc.
\end{inparaenum}
Knowingly, it improves state-of-the-art approaches in the traditional
connection set-up. This improvement is crucial in the three-way connection
set-up and opens the gate to a vast variety of distributed applications.


The rest of this paper is organized as follow: Section~\ref{sec:background}
introduces the necessary background to understand \SCAMPLON{} and highlights
our motivations. Section~\ref{sec:proposal} details the \SCAMPLON{} protocol.
Section~\ref{sec:experiments} shows the properties of \SCAMPLON{} and compare
them to state-of-the-art random peer sampling
approaches. Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork} reviews the related work. We conclude
and discuss about perspective in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
