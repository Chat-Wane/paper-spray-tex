\section{Introduction}

Peer sampling constitutes a fundamental mechanism for many large-scale
distributed applications both on the
cloud~\cite{decandia2007dynamo} and in a peer-to-peer
setting. Services such as dissemination~\cite{eugster2003lightweight,
  tolgyeski2009adaptive}, aggregation~\cite{jelasity2004epidemic} and
network management~\cite{jelasity2009tman, voulgaris2005epidemic} have
been based on peer sampling and the recent introduction of
WebRTC\footnote{\url{http://www.webrtc.org/}} opens the opportunity to
deploy such applications on browsers that can run on laptops, desktops
and mobile devices. In this context, WebRTC drastically simplifies
deployment even within complex network systems that utilize firewalls,
proxies and Net Address Translation (NAT).

Unfortunately, WebRTC has several constraints that make existing peer sampling
services inefficient or unreliable. Brow\-sers can run on small devices in
mobile networks. Hence, keeping the number of connections as low as possible is
a major requirement. However, peer sampling services such as
\CYCLON~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon} do not adapt the number of connections to the
real number of participants. For instance, a user must maintain 10 connections
with other remote browsers when only 6 are enough. It becomes crucial when these
connections are actively used to broadcast messages. On the other hand, the peer
sampling service \SCAMP~\cite{ganesh2003peer} is adaptive but uses random
dissemination paths to establish connections which is much more costly and
likely to fail in the WebRTC context.

In this paper, we introduce \SPRAY, a random peer sampling protocol inspired by
both \SCAMP~\cite{ganesh2003peer}
and \CYCLON~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon}. Compared to the state of art,
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item \SPRAY dynamically adapts the neighborhood of each peer. Thus, the number
  of connections grows logarithmically compared to the size of the network.
\item \SPRAY only uses neighbor-to-neighbor interactions to establish
  connections. Thus, the connections are established in constant time.
\item \SPRAY quickly converges to a topology exposing properties similar to
  those of a random graph. Thus, the network becomes robust to massive
  failures, quickly disseminates information etc.
\item In the experimental setup, we show the adaptiveness of \SPRAY and
  highlight its efficiency improvement compared to \CYCLON and \SCAMP, at the
  cost of little overhead.
\end{inparaenum}

In turns, information dissemination protocols built on top of \SPRAY also become
adaptive. We highlight this behavior using a decentralized collaborative
real-time editor\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Chat-Wane/CRATE}} directly
accessible in web browsers. As expected, the experiments running on Grid'5000
and involving uptill 600 editors confirm the scalability and efficiency of the
gossip protocol.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork}
reviews the related work. Section~\ref{sec:proposal}
details the \SPRAY protocol. Section~\ref{sec:experiments} shows the properties
of \SPRAY and compares them to state-of-the-art random peer sampling
approaches. We conclude and discuss about the perspective in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
