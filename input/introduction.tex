WebRtc drastically simplified direct connection between browsers even
with complex network settings such as firewall, proxies or Net Address
Translation (NAT).  Some attractive applications such as FireFox Hello
or WebTorrent demonstrates how it can be easy for end-users to do
video-conferencing of file-sharing directly in browsers without a
third-party providers. However, a different kind of applications such
as distributed social network or distributed collaborative editing
requires each participant to broadcast messages to a potentially high
number of participants. This is traditionally achieved by using
gossiping algorithms. Unfortunately, applying current gossiping
algorithms in a webrtc network raises issues on reliability and
efficiency. 

Gossiping requires each participant to maintain connections with a
uniform sampling of all others participants. The size of this partial
view is logarithmic to the number of participants. In order to prevent
network partitions, this neighboring has to be constantly renewed. In
webrtc, establishing a browser-to-browser connection require a
three-way handshake that is much more costly and likely to fail than
in a traditional setting. Moreover, the established connection can
rely on a TURN server that is ressource intensive.  Consequently,
existing gossiping algorithms will either consume too much ressources,
or fail to maintain a connected network.

The \CYCLON{} protocol~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon} provides each peer
with a fixed size partial view.  Each element in this view has an age
which allows quick withdrawing of left peers. Nevertheless, the user
must foresee the maximum size of the network to set the appropriate
view size. As such, the views are generally oversized generating too
much ressource consumption in a webrtc network. On the other hand, the
\SCAMP{} protocol~\cite{ganesh2001scamp,ganesh2003peer} incrementally
builds the partial views of peers at join. Thus, each peer has a
partial view size logarithmically growing compared to the global size
of the network. Nevertheless, a peer may connect to peers at several
hops from him. Hence, the connections are more likely to fail.

In this paper, we introduce \SCAMPLON{}, a random peer sampling protocol
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item which provides each peer with a logarithmically growing partial view size
  compared to the global network size,
\item which quickly converges to a random graph,
\item which can handle three-way handshake.
\end{inparaenum}
Experiments shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both in
one-way connections and three-way handshake connections.

\section{Introduction}
Random peer sampling~\cite{jelasity2004peer} is an essential ground to many
distributed applications. Since the peers cannot afford to have global
knowledge of the network membership, they only have a partial view of the
latter. Using these partial views, the peers are able to perform many tasks. In
particular, it allows a scalable yet highly reliable broadcasting which
constitutes the core of numerous decentralized applications (REFs). However,
current random peer sampling approaches are not entirely satisfying.

The \CYCLON{} protocol~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon} provides each peer with a
fixed size partial view.  Each element in this view has an age which allows
quick withdrawing of left peers. Nevertheless, the user must foresee the
maximum size of the network to set the appropriate view size. As such, the
views are generally oversized. On the other hand, the \SCAMP{}
protocol~\cite{ganesh2001scamp,ganesh2003peer} incrementally builds the partial
views of peers at join. Thus, each peer has a partial view size logarithmically
growing compared to the global size of the network. Nevertheless, a peer may
connect to peers at several hops from him. Hence, the connections are more
likely to fail.  Furthermore, both approaches do not consider three-way
handshake connections set-up which becomes increasingly important with
technologies such as WebRTC, Allowing peer-to-peer connections establishment
directly within modern web browser. In such context, each connection
matters. Therefore, oversizing the partial views as in \CYCLON{} becomes a
heavy burden. Also, handshaking requires a round trip of joining messages which
increases the \SCAMP{}'s complexity of failures. \SCAMP{} becomes unusable in
pratice.

In this paper, we introduce \SCAMPLON{}, a random peer sampling protocol
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item which provides each peer with a logarithmically growing partial view size
  compared to the global network size,
\item which quickly converges to a random graph,
\item which can handle three-way handshake.
\end{inparaenum}
Experiments shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both in
one-way connections and three-way handshake connections.

The rest of this paper is organized as follow: Section~\ref{sec:background}
introduces the necessary background to understand \SCAMPLON{} and highlights
our motivations. Section~\ref{sec:proposal} details the \SCAMPLON{} protocol.
Section~\ref{sec:experiments} shows the properties of \SCAMPLON{} and compare
them to state-of-the-art random peer sampling
approaches. Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork} reviews the related work. We conclude
and discuss about perspective in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
