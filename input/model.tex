\section{Model}

We consider a set $V$ of peers labelled from $p_1$ to $p_N$.  The peers can
crash or leave at any time without giving notice, and they can recover or
re-enter the network freely. We consider only non-byzantine peers.

A multiset of arcs $E = (p_f,\,p_t) \in V \times V$ allows $p_f$ to communicate
with $p_t$ but not the converse. The multiset of arcs is dynamic, i.e., arcs
appear and disappear over time. The network $\mathcal{N}^t \in V \times E$ is a
\emph{network overlay} at the given time $t$.

The multiset of arcs starting from $p_f$ is called the \emph{partial view} of
$p_f$, noted $\mathcal{P}_f$. The destination peers in this view are the
\emph{neighbors} of $p_f$. A partial view can contain arcs that are stale when
the neighbor has left or crashed.

The peers communicate by the mean of messages. They only send messages to their
neighbors. A departed peer cannot send messages. An arc can fail to deliver a
message. A stale arc systematically fails.
