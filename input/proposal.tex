\label{sec:proposal}

\SPRAY is an adaptive-by-design random peer sampling protocol inspired by
\SCAMP~\cite{ganesh2003peer} and \CYCLON~\cite{voulgaris2005cyclon}. It
comprises three parts representing the lifecycle of a peer in the network.
First, the joining process injects a logarithmically growing number of arcs
into the network. Hence, the number of arcs scales with the network size.  Next,
each peer runs a periodic process in order to balance the partial views both in
terms of partial view size and uniformity of the referenced peers within
them. Quickly, the overlay network converges to a topology exposing properties
close to those of random graphs. Finally, A peer is able to leave at any time 
without giving notice (equivalent to a crash) while the network properties do
not degrade.

The key of adaptiveness consists in keeping a consistent global number of arcs
during the whole protocol. Indeed, unlike \CYCLON, \SPRAY is always on the edge
of the optimal number of arcs compared to the network size. Since \SPRAY never
creates additional arcs after the joining, any removal is a definitive
loss. Thus, firstly, \SPRAY's joining adds some arcs to the network. Secondly,
\SPRAY's shuffling preserves all arcs in the network. Thirdly, \SPRAY's leaving
cautiously removes some arcs, ideally the number of arcs introduced by the last
joining peer.

Occasionally, keeping the global number of arcs constant forces the shuffling
and the leaving processes to create \emph{duplicates} in partial views. Thus,
a partial view may contain multiple occurrences of a particular neighbor. In this
paper, we show that the number of duplicates remains low and do not impact the
network connectedness.

\subsection{Joining}

\SPRAY's joining algorithm is the only part of the protocol where the
global number of arcs in the network can increase. To meet the first
requirement of the problem statement, this number of arcs must grow
logarithmically compared to the network size. As in \SCAMP, we assume that
peers meet this constraint. Therefore, each of them uses this knowledge to
propagate the identity of the joining peer. Algorithm~\ref{algo:joining}
describes \SPRAY's joining protocol. Line~\ref{line:multicast} shows that
the contacted peer only multicasts the new identity to its
neighborhood. Afterwards, to limit the risk of connection failures, each
neighbor immediately adds the joining peer to their own neighborhood. This
fulfills the second condition of the problem statement.  In total, the number
of arcs in the network increases of $1+\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)$ using only
neighbor-to-neighbor interactions.

    protocol. }
\end{figure*}

\begin{algorithm}

\caption{\label{algo:joining}The joining protocol of \SPRAY.}
\end{algorithm}

The partial view is a multiset of pairs $\langle n,\, age\rangle$ which
associate to the neighbor $n$ with the age $age$. The multiset allows managing
duplicates and $age$ plays the same role as in \CYCLON i.e.  it accelerates
the removal of crashed/departed peers by shuffling with the oldest neighbors
first. The $onSubs$ event is called each time a peer joins the
network. $onSubs$ forwards the identity of the joining peer to all neighbors,
independent of the age. The $onFwdSubs$ event is called when a peer receives
such forwarded subscription. It adds the peer as one of its neighbor with an
age set to $0$ meaning that it is a brand new reference.

Figure~\ref{fig:joiningexample} depicts a joining scenario.
Peer $p_1$ contacts $p_2$ to join the network composed of $\{p_2$, $p_3$,
$p_4$, $p_5$, $p_6\}$. For simplicity sake, the figure shows only the new arcs
and the neighborhood of $p_1$ and $p_2$. Peer $p_1$ directly adds $p_2$ in its
partial view. Peer $p_2$ forwards the identity of $p_1$ to its
neighborhood. Each of these neighbors adds $p_1$ in their partial view. In
total, \SPRAY establishes 5 connections and the network is connected.

Unfortunately, the partial views of the newest peers are clearly unbalanced and
violates the first condition of our problem statement. The periodic protocol
described in the next section will re-balance the partial views.

\subsection{Shuffling}
\label{subsec:cyclic}

Unlike \CYCLON, \SPRAY shuffles partial views of different sizes. The shuffling
aims to balance the partial view sizes and to randomly mix the neighborhood
between peers. Nevertheless, the global number of arcs in the network is
invariant.

In \SPRAY's shuffling protocol, the involved peers send half of their partial
view to each other. After integration, they both tend to the average of their
partial views and the sum of their partial views stays unchanged. In order to
keep the arc number invariant, the partial views of \SPRAY are multisets. If a
peer receives an already known reference, it still stores it, yet as a
duplicate. Thus, the \SPRAY's shuffling protocol never increases nor decreases
the arcs count.

If duplicates have negative impact on the network properties, most of them
disappear after shuffling and they proportionally become negligible as the
network grows (see Section~\ref{subsec:duplicates}).

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \input{./input/cyclicalgo.tex}
  \caption{\label{algo:scamplon}The cyclic protocol of \SPRAY.}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{algo:scamplon} shows the \SPRAY protocol running at each
peer. It is divided between an active thread looping to update the partial
view, and a passive thread which reacts to an exchange message. The functions
which are not explicitly defined are the following:
\begin{compactitem}
\item $incrementAge(view)$: increments the age of each elements in the view
  and returns the modified view.
\item $getOldest(view)$: retrieves the oldest of peers contained in the view.
\item $getSample(view, \, size)$: returns a sample of the view containing
  $size$ elements.
\item $replace(view,\,old,\,new)$: replaces in the view all occurrences of
  the $old$ element by the $new$ element and returns the modified view.
\item $rand()$: generates a random floating number between $0$ and $1$.
\end{compactitem}

In the active thread, Function $loop$ is called every $\Delta$ time
$t$. First, the function increments the age of each neighbor in
$\mathcal{P}$. Then, the oldest peer $q$ is chosen to exchange a subset of its
partial view. If Peer $q$ cannot be reached (i.e. it crashed/left), the peer
$p$ executes the crash handling function (cf. Section~\ref{subsec:leaving}) and
repeats the process until it finds a reachable peer $q$. Thus, the aging
process (which is an inheritance from \CYCLON) speeds up the removal of
crashed or departed peers. Once it finds a reachable neighbor $q$, Peer $p$
selects a sample of its partial view, excluding one occurrence of $q$ and
including itself. The size of this sample is half of its partial view, with at
least one peer: the initiating peer (cf. Line~\ref{line:samplesize}). The
answer of $q$ contains half of its partial view. Since peers can appear
multiple times in $\mathcal{P}$, the exchanging peers may send references to
the other peer, e.g., Peer $o$'s sample can contain references to $q$. Such
sample, without further processing, would create self-loop ($q$'s partial view
contains references to $q$). To alleviate this undesirable behavior, all
occurrences of the other peer are replaced with the emitting peer
(cf. Line~\ref{line:replace1},~\ref{line:replace2}).  Afterwards, both of them
remove the sample they sent from their view and add the received sample.

Figure~\ref{fig:cyclicexample} depicts \SPRAY's cyclic
procedure. This scenario follows from Figure~\ref{fig:joiningexample}:
Peer $p_1$ just joined the network. Peer $p_6$ initiates an exchange
with $p_1$ (the oldest among the $p_6$'s partial view). It randomly
chooses $\left\lceil{|\mathcal{P}_6|\div 2}\right\rceil = 1$ peer
among its neighborhood. In this case, it picks $p_9$ from
$\{p_9,\,p_8,\,p_7\}$.  It sends the chosen peer plus its own identity
to Peer $p_1$. In response, the latter picks
$\left\lceil{|\mathcal{P}_1|\div 2}\right\rceil = 1$ peer from its
partial view. It sends back its sole neighbor $p_2$ and directly adds
the received neighbor to its partial view. After receipt, Peer $p_6$
removes the sent neighbors from its partial view, removes an
occurrence of $p_1$, and adds the received peer from $p_1$. The peers
$\{p_6,\,p_9\}$ compose the $p_1$'s partial view. The peers
$\{p_2,\,p_7,\,p_8\}$ compose the $p_6$'s partial view.

The example shows that, at first, the initiating peer has $4$ peers in
its partial view, while the receiving peer has only $1$ peer.
After the exchange, the former has $3$ neighbors including $1$ new
peer. The receiving peer has $2$ neighbors, and both of them are
new. Thus, the periodic procedure tends to even out the partial view
size of network members. It also scatters neighbors in order to remove
the highly clustered groups which may appear because of the joining
protocol.

Concerning convergence time of the shuffling algorithm, there exists a close
relationship between \SPRAY and the proactive aggregation protocol introduced
in~\cite{jelasity2004epidemic,montresor2004robust}. It states that, under the
assumption of a peer sampling sufficiently random, the mean value $\mu$ and the
variance $\sigma^2$ at a given cycle $i$ are:
\begin{center}
  $\mu_i = {1\over{|\mathcal{N}|}} \sum\limits_{x \in \mathcal{N}} a_{i,\,x}$
  \hfill
  $\sigma^2_i = {1\over{|\mathcal{N}|-1}}\sum\limits_{x \in \mathcal{N}}
  (a_{i,\,x} - \mu_i)^2$
\end{center}
where $a_{i,\,x}$ is the value held by Peer $p_x$ at cycle $i$. The estimated
variance must converge to $0$ over cycles. In other terms, the values tends to
be the same over cycles. In the \SPRAY case, the value $a_{i,\,x}$ is the
partial view size of Peer $p_x$ at cycle $i$. Indeed, each exchange from Peer
$p_1$ to Peer $p_2$ is an aggregation resulting to:
$|\mathcal{P}_1|\approx|\mathcal{P}_2|\approx{(|\mathcal{P}_1| +
  |\mathcal{P}_2|) \div 2}$.
Furthermore, at each cycle, each peer is involved in the exchange protocol at
least once (they initiate one), and in the best case 1+Poisson(1) (they
initiate one and, in average, each peer receives another one). This relation
being established, we know that \SPRAY's partial view sizes converge
exponentially fast to the global average size. Additionally, we know that each
cycle decreases their variance in overall system at a rate comprised between
${1\div 2}$ and $1\div ({2\sqrt{\text{e}}})$.

The shuffling algorithm provides adaptiveness at the cost of
duplicates. Averaging the partial view sizes over exchanges provides a quick
convergence to a network topology where the partial views are balanced.

\subsection{Leaving and crashing}
\label{subsec:leaving}

Using \SPRAY, the peers are free to leave the network without giving notice. In
that regard, we do not handle departures and crashes differently.
Without any appropriate reaction, the network may collapse due to an over
zealous removal of arcs. Indeed, when a peer joins the network, it injects
$1+\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)$ arcs. Nevertheless, after few exchanges, the partial
view of the joining peer becomes populated with more neighbors. Then, if this
peer leaves, it removes $\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)$ arcs from its partial view, and
another $\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)$ arcs from peers which have this peer in their
partial view. Therefore, without any crash handler, we remove
$2\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)$ connections instead of $1+\ln(|\mathcal{N}|)$. To
alleviate this issue, each peer that detects a crash may reestablish a
connection with anyone in its neighborhood (which will spread in the network
over the exchanges). The probability of reestablishing a connection is
$1-{1\div{|\mathcal{P}|}}$. Since ${|\mathcal{P}|}\approx \ln(|\mathcal{N}|)$
peers have the crashed peer in their partial view, it is likely that all of
them will reestablish a connection, excepted one. Therefore, when a peer
leaves, it approximately removes the number of connections it injected when it
joined.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \input{./input/unreachablealgo.tex}
  \caption{\label{algo:unreachable}The crash/departure handler of \SPRAY.}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{algo:unreachable} shows the manner in which \SPRAY deals with
departures and crashes.  Function $onPeerDown$ shows the reaction of \SPRAY
when the peer $q$ is detected as crashed or departed. A first loop counts the
occurrences of this neighbor in the partial view, and removes all of
them. Then, the second loop probabilistically duplicates the reference of a
known peer. The probability depends of the partial view size before the
removals.

Figure~\ref{fig:crashexample} depicts the \SPRAY's crash/leaving handler. The
scenario follows from prior examples after few other exchanges. Peer $p_1$
leaves the network without giving notice. With it, $7$ connections are
down. Peers $p_3$, $p_4$, and $p_5$ have the crashed/left peer in their partial
view. Peer $p_5$ has $1-{1\div{|\mathcal{P}_5|}}={2\div{3}}$ chance to replace
the dead connections. In this case, it duplicates the connection to
$p_{13}$. Identically, $p_3$ and $p_4$ detect the crash/leaving and run the
appropriate operation. Only $p_3$ duplicates one of its connection. In total,
$5$ connections have been removed.

The example shows that some peers reestablish connections if they detect a dead
connection. The probability depends on the partial view size of each of these
peer. In average, one of these peers will likely remove the arc while the other
peers will duplicate one of their existing arcs. In this case, Peer $p_1$
injected $5$ connections when it joined. It removes $7-2 =5 $ connections when
it leaves. The global number of connections remains logarithmic compared to the
number of members in the network. Nevertheless, we can see that connectedness
is not entirely guaranteed (only with the high probability implied by random
graphs). Indeed, if Peer $p_1$ is the sole bridge between two clusters, adding
arcs is not enough to ensure connectedness.

Algorithm~\ref{algo:unreachable} also shows that \SPRAY distinguishes peer
crashes and arc crashes. Indeed, Function $onArcDown$ deals with connection
establishment failures. In this function, the failing arc is systematically
replaced with a duplicate. Therefore, the arc count stays invariant even in
presence of connection establishment failures. The distinction between the
functions $onPeerDown$ and $onArcDown$ is necessary because the former is
supposed to remove a small arc quantity over departures, contrarily to the
latter. Without this small removal, the global arc count would grow unbounded
with network turnover.

In the context of WebRTC, \SPRAY calls the $onArcDown$ function when a connection
establishement fails. \SPRAY calls the $onPeerDown$ function when the
connection was established once but the neighbor is not responding anymore.

% To summarize, \SPRAY provides:
% \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
% \item a logarithmically increasing partial view size compared to the global
%   network size,
% \item a connections establishement.
% %%\item an exponentially fast convergence to a random graph.
% \end{inparaenum}
% Providing both these properties, \SPRAY improves the state-of-the-art
% approaches in the traditional connection set-up. Furthermore, the improvement
% becomes crucial in the context of three-way handshake connection set-up.  The
% latter becomes increasingly important with the appearance of technologies
% allowing peer-to-peer within modern web browsers.  The next section aims to
% demonstrate experimentally the behavior of \SPRAY. In particular, it aims to
% highlight the aforementioned properties.
