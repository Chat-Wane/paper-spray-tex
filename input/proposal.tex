\label{sec:proposal}

Scamplon\footnote{Scamplon stands as the contraction of Scamp and Cyclon.} is a
random peer sampling protocol inspired by both Scamp and Cyclon. It provides
the best of its parents: a logarithmically increasing partial view size
compared to the global network size, and fast convergence to a random graph
using only neighbour-to-neighbour connection establishments. As such, it
constitutes an improvement over state-of-the-art approaches in the common
context of one-way connections. Additionally, it greatly outperforms
state-of-the-art in the three-way handshake connection establishments. The
latter context becomes increasingly important with the apparition of technology
allowing peer-to-peer within modern web browsers. This section details the
Scamplon protocol through intuitions, examples and algorithms.
