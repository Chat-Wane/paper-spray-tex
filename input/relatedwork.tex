\subsection{Network size estimators}
There exists a plethora of network size estimator, either using sampling
technics (REF?), sketching technics (REF?), or averaging technics (REF?). Using
such estimator to resize the partial view of each peer is possible. However,
these approaches are often very costly, and can assume some network properties
(e.g. no dynamic network during an estimating). On the other hand, Scamplon
provides partial views logarithmically growing compared to the network
size. Thus, it implies no overhead since it converges by design to a random
graph. Then, each peer is able to compute a rough estimate of the network size.
